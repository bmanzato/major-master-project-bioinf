20301614|t|Blepharophimosis, Ptosis, and Epicanthus Inversus
20301614|a|CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Blephariphimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a complex eyelid malformation invariably characterized by four major features: blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus, and telecanthus. BPES type I includes the four major features and premature ovarian insufficiency (POI); BPES type II includes only the four major features. Other ophthalmic manifestations that can be associated with BPES include lacrimal duct anomalies, amblyopia, strabismus, and refractive errors. Minor features include a broad nasal bridge, low-set ears, and a short philtrum. Individuals with BPES and an intragenic FOXL2 pathogenic variant are expected to have normal intelligence, in contrast to affected individuals with cytogenetic rearrangements that involve FOXL2 and additional genes. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of BPES is primarily based on clinical findings. Occasionally individuals with BPES have cytogenetic rearrangements, such as interstitial deletions and translocations involving 3q23. FOXL2 is the only gene currently known to be associated with BPES. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Timing of eyelid surgery involves balancing the benefits of early surgery to prevent deprivation amblyopia versus late surgery to allow for more reliable ptosis measurements. Surgery traditionally involves a medial canthoplasty for correction of the blepharophimosis, epicanthus inversus, and telecanthus at age three to five years, typically followed a year later by ptosis correction; recently, a one-stage surgical procedure has been described. Premature ovarian failure is treated with hormone replacement therapy; fertility is addressed with reproductive technologies such as embryo donation and egg donation. Surveillance: Ophthalmic follow up depends on age, procedures performed in the past, and results of visual acuity testing. Endocrinologic and gynecologic follow up are advised for affected females. GENETIC COUNSELING: BPES is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner; autosomal recessive inheritance has been reported in one consanguineous family. For autosomal dominant inheritance: Each child of an individual with BPES has a 50% chance of inheriting the FOXL2 pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the pathogenic variant in the family has been identified; however, requests for prenatal testing for conditions such as BPES are not common.

21455822|t|A one-stage correction of the blepharophimosis syndrome using a standard combination of surgical techniques.
21455822|a|BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a one-stage treatment for the blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) using a combination of standard surgical techniques. METHODS: This is a retrospective interventional case series study of 21 BPES patients with a 1-year minimum follow-up period. The one-stage intervention combined three different surgical procedures in the following order: Z-epicanthoplasty for the epicanthus, transnasal wiring of the medial canthal ligaments for the telecanthus, and a bilateral fascia lata sling for ptosis correction. Preoperative and postoperative measurements of the horizontal lid fissure length (HFL), vertical lid fissure width (VFW), nasal intercanthal distance (ICD), and the ratio between the intercanthal distance and the horizontal fissure length (ICD/HFL) were analyzed using Student's t test for paired variables. RESULTS: The mean preoperative measurements were 4.95 +- 1.13 mm for the VFW, 20.90 +- 2.14 mm for the HFL, 42.45 +- 2.19 mm for the ICD, and 2.04 +- 0.14 mm for the ICD/HFL ratio. The mean postoperative measurements were 7.93 +- 1.02 mm for the VFW, 26.36 +- 1.40 mm for the HFL, 32.07 +- 1.96 mm for the ICD, and 1.23 +- 0.09 mm for the ICD/HFL ratio. All these values and their differences were statistically significant (P < 0.0001). All of the patients developed symmetric postoperative inferior version lagophthalmus, a complication that tended to decrease over time. CONCLUSION: One-stage correction of BPES is safe and efficient with the surgical techniques described.

21562436|t|Correction of the lower eyelid malpositioning in the blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome.
21562436|a|PURPOSE: Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is an autosomal dominant complex eyelid malformation. The authors aim to offer an explanation for the lower eyelid malformation and propose a novel surgical approach to correct it. METHODS: An observational and interventional case series of 10 consecutive, molecularly proven BPES patients who underwent surgical repair of the lower eyelid malformation. During surgery detailed anatomical examination and surgical repositioning of the medial canthal tendon was performed. All the patients were followed up regularly after the surgery and assessed for epiphora. RESULTS: All patients exhibited a marked asymmetry in the attachment of the lower and upper eyelid to the medial canthal tendon, with the lower eyelid being much less attached. This resulted in an abnormal downward concavity with a temporal ectropion and a temporally displaced lower eyelid. Consequently, the inferior punctum was displaced temporally. All patients underwent a novel surgical technique to remediate this, namely, inserting a 4.0 nylon suture between the tarsal plate of the lower eyelid and the medial canthal tendon during telecanthus surgery. This simple additional surgical step corrected not only the position of the lower eyelid but also its abnormal downward concavity, the temporal ectropion and the lateral displacement of the inferior punctum. None of the authors' patients had lasting epiphora. CONCLUSION: Lateral displacement of the inferior punctum is an important hallmark in the diagnosis of BPES. The authors demonstrate an anatomical explanation for the complex lower eyelid malformation and also propose a novel surgical technique to correct this. During surgical repair of the telecanthus and blepharophimosis, specific attention should be paid to reattachment of the lower eyelid to the medial canthal tendon. This understanding improves clinical diagnosis and surgical treatment of BPES patients.

21632871|t|Mutational probing of the forkhead domain of the transcription factor FOXL2 provides insights into the pathogenicity of naturally occurring mutations.
21632871|a|Mutations of the transcription factor FOXL2, involved in cranio-facial and ovarian development, lead to the Blepharophimosis Syndrome. Here, we have systematically replaced the amino acids of the helices of the forkhead domain (FHD) of FOXL2 by glycine residues to assess the impact of such substitutions. A number of mutations lead to protein mislocalization, aggregation and to partial or complete loss of transactivation ability on a series of luciferase reporter systems. To rationalize the results of this glycine mutation scan, we have modeled the structure of the FHD by comparison with crystallographic data available for other FHDs. We failed to detect a clear-cut correlation between protein mislocalization or aggregation and the position of the mutation. However, we found that the localization of the side chain of each amino acid strongly correlated with the impact of its mutation on FOXL2 transactivation capacity. Indeed, when the side chains of the amino acids involved in the helices of the forkhead are supposed to point towards the hydrophobic core formed by the three main helices, a loss of function was observed. On the contrary, if the side chains point outward the hydrophobic core, protein function was preserved. The extension of this analysis to natural mutants shows that a similar correlation can be found for BPES mutations associated or not with ovarian dysfunction. Our findings reveal new insights into the molecular effects of FOXL2 mutations affecting the FHD, which represent two-thirds of intragenic mutations, and provide the first  predictive tool of their effects.

21763750|t|The transcription factor FOXL2: at the crossroads of ovarian physiology and pathology.
21763750|a|FOXL2 is a gene encoding a forkhead transcription factor. Its mutations or misregulation have been shown to cause the blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus (BPES) syndrome and more recently have been associated with the development of Ovarian Granulosa Cell Tumors (OGCT). BPES is a genetic disorder involving mild craniofacial abnormalities often associated with premature ovarian failure. OGCTs are endocrine malignancies, accounting for 2-5% of ovarian cancers, the treatment of which is still challenging. In this review we summarize recent data concerning FOXL2 transcriptional targets and molecular partners, its post-translational modifications, its mutations and its involvement in newly discovered pathophysiological processes. In the ovary, FOXL2 is involved in the regulation of cholesterol and steroid metabolism, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species detoxification and cell proliferation. Interestingly, one of the main roles of FOXL2 is also to preserve the identity of ovarian granulosa cells even at the adult stage and to prevent their transdifferentiation into Sertoli-like cells. All these recent advances indicate that FOXL2 is central to ovarian development and maintenance. The elucidation of the impact of FOXL2 germinal and somatic mutations will allow a better understanding of the pathogenesis of BPES and of OGCTs.

21934608|t|Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome plus:  deletion 3q22.3q23 in a patient with characteristic facial features and with genital anomalies, spastic diplegia, and speech delay.
21934608|a|Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome(BPES; OMIM110100) is a genetic disorder usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Primarily, its diagnosis is based on four major features present at birth: short horizontal palpebral fissures (blepharophimosis), drooping of the eyelids (ptosis), a vertical fold of skin from the lower eyelid up either side of the nose (epicanthus inversus), and lateral displacement of the inner canthi with normal interpupillary distance(telecanthus; Oley and Baraitser, 1988). Two types of BPES are recognized: type I BPES includes the four major eyelid features and female infertility as a result of premature ovarian failure, whereas type II BPES consists only of eyelid abnormalities (Zlotogora et al., 1983). BPES is sometimes associated with developmental delay, but patients with BPES typically have a normal lifespan (Oley and Baraitser, 1988; Beysen et al., 2009). The clinical diagnosis of BPES is confirmed with demonstration of a FOXL2 mutation, subtle FOXL2 deletion or 3q23 microdeletion, or deletion of the FOXL2 regulatory region (Crisponi et al., 2001; De Baere et al., 2003; Beysen et al., 2005; D'haene et al., 2009). FOXL2, located at 3q23, is the only gene currently known to be associated with BPES (Beysen et al., 2009). It is possible to identify an underlying genetic defect in 88% of BPES cases diagnosed clinically (Beysen et al., 2009). Of the genetic defects found, approximately 81% are intragenic mutations of FOXL2, 10-12% are microdeletions of the gene or surrounding areas, and 5% are deletions in the regulatory areas (Beysen et al., 2009; D'haene et al., 2009,2010). In BPES-like patients (i.e. those displaying some,but not all four major features of BPES), other copy number changes can be detected in 33% of cases(Gijsbers et al., 2008). Patients with BPES carrying larger deletions encompassing FOXL2 present more frequently with associated clinical findings, such as mental retardation (D'haene et al., 2009). In this study, we present a child with BPES caused by a large interstitial deletion,3q22.3q23 (chr3:139 354 104-144 013 999)(hg18), which includes FOXL2. In addition to the classic features of BPES, he presents with an external genital anomaly,spastic diplegia, and speech delay.

22159675|t|Insights into levator muscle dysfunction in a cohort of patients with molecularly confirmed blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome using high-resolution imaging, anatomic examination, and histopathologic examination.
22159675|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the basis of defective levator palpebrae superioris (LPS) function in blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES), an autosomal dominant eyelid malformation sometimes associated with ovarian dysfunction. METHODS: Eight patients with molecularly proved BPES underwent high-resolution surface-coil 3-T magnetic resonance imaging before surgical intervention. The features of LPS muscle and adjoining connective tissue were compared with an age-matched control subject. During LPS resection for ptosis repair, detailed anatomic examination of the LPS was performed. Histopathologic characteristics were compared with normal control samples from a cadaver and a patient with simple severe congenital ptosis. RESULTS: The most striking feature shown on magnetic resonance imaging was the thin, long anterior part of the LPS. During the operation, this consisted of a disorganized, thin, long aponeurosis. However, in the posterior part of the LPS, there was an organized thick structure suggestive of a muscle belly. Histopathologic examination revealed posteriorly well-formed striated muscle fibers in all patients with BPES but not in the control sample from the patient with simple severe congenital ptosis. These striated muscle fibers were comparable to those of the normal control tissue but were more intermixed with collagenous tissue and little fatty degeneration. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of striated muscle fibers in LPS of patients with BPES contrasts with the fatty degeneration in patients with simple severe congenital ptosis. To our knowledge, this is the first study providing novel insights into the pathogenesis of the eyelid malformation in BPES through extensive imaging, anatomic study, and histopathologic testing in a unique cohort of patients with molecularly proved BPES.

22171663|t|Microdeletion found by array-CGH in girl with blepharophimosis syndrome and apparently balanced translocation t(3;15)(q23;q25).
22171663|a|BACKGROUND: Blepharophimosis, ptosis and epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a rare autosomal dominant congenital disorder. Mutations in FOXL2, a gene located at 3q23, have been shown to cause the syndrome. We report a girl with BPES with a "de novo" apparently balanced translocation between chromosomes 3 and 15: t(3;15)(q23;q25). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Conventional cytogenetic and CGH array were performed. RESULTS: The karyotype showed an apparently balanced translocation. Molecular studies by array-CGH did not show deletions in the FOXL2 gene; however, a novel 63.2 kb deletion involving a non-protein-coding gene (PISRT1) was found. CONCLUSIONS: The novel deletion found could be involved in FOXL2 regulation and constitutes the smallest deletion described in a female with BPES. In cases of "de novo" apparently balanced translocation, only a 5-6% risk of phenotype alteration is described. Molecular studies can help to discover these alterations and provide insight for genetic counseling.

22241538|t|[Blepharophimosis ptosis epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) (corrected)].
22241538|a|The blepharophimosis ptosis epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES, also known as Waardenburg syndrome) was probably first reported by Ammon in 1841 and discribed more fully by Vignes in 1889. Its primary effects on the soft tissue of the midface are blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus and telecanthus. It starts with the epicanthic folds at about the age of 3-4 years, followed by the correction of the ptosis about 9-12 months later. Early surgery may be necessary for amblyopia. In 1995 the gene locus was identified as 3Q23. BPES is due to a mutation within a single gene, the FOXL2 gene. In female patients an early childhood ovarian insufficiency must be excluded.

22248822|t|FOXL2 impairment in human disease.
22248822|a|FOXL2 encodes a forkhead transcription factor that plays important roles in the ovary during development and in post-natal, adult life. Here, we focus on the clinical consequences of FOXL2 impairment in human disease. In line with other forkhead transcription factors, its constitutional genetic defects and a somatic mutation lead to developmental disease and cancer, respectively. More than 100 unique constitutional mutations and regulatory defects have been found in blepharophimosis syndrome (BPES), a complex eyelid malformation associated (type I) or not (type II) with premature ovarian failure (POF). In agreement with the BPES phenotype, FOXL2 is expressed in the developing eyelids and in fetal and adult ovaries. Two knock-out mice and at least one natural animal model, the Polled Intersex Syndrome goat, are known. They recapitulate the BPES phenotype and have provided many insights into the ovarian pathology. Only a few constitutional mutations have been described in nonsyndromic POF. Moreover, a recurrent somatic mutation p.C134W was found to be specific for adult ovarian granulo-sa cell tumors. Functional studies investigating the consequences of FOXL2 mutations or regulatory defects have shed light on the molecular pathogenesis of the aforementioned conditions, and contributed considerably to genotype-phenotype correlations. Recently, a conditional knock-out of Foxl2 in the mouse induced somatic transdifferentiation of ovary into testis in adult mice, suggesting that Foxl2 has an anti-testis function in the adult ovary. This changed our view on the ovary and testis as terminally differentiated organs in adult mammals. Finally, this might have potential implications for the understanding and treatment of frequent conditions such as POF and polycystic ovary syndrome.

22312189|t|Missense mutation outside the forkhead domain of FOXL2 causes a severe form of BPES type II.
22312189|a|PURPOSE: Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a developmental disease characterized by a complex eyelid malformation associated or not with premature ovarian failure (POF). BPES is essentially an autosomal dominant disease, due to mutations in the forkhead box L2 (FOXL2) gene, encoding a forkhead transcription factor. More than one hundred unique FOXL2 mutations have been described in BPES in different populations, many of which are missense mutations in the forkhead domain. Here, we report on a very severe form of BPES resulting from a missense mutation outside the forkhead domain. METHODS: A clinical and molecular genetic investigation was performed in affected and unaffected members of an Iranian family with BPES. The FOXL2 coding region was sequenced in an index case. Targeted mutation testing was performed in 8 family members. RESULTS: We have identified a heterozygous FOXL2 missense mutation c.650C G (p.Ser217Cys) co-segregating with disease in members of a three-generation family with BPES type II. Only few missense mutations have been reported outside the forkhead domain so far. They were all found in mild BPES, in line with in vitro studies demonstrating mostly normal localization and normal or increased transactivation properties of the mutant proteins. Unlike previous studies, affected members of the family studied here showed a severe BPES phenotype, with bilateral amblyopia due to uncorrected ptosis. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study demonstrating a severe BPES phenotype resulting from a FOXL2 missense mutation outside the forkhead domain, expanding our knowledge about the phenotypic consequences of missense mutations outside the forkhead domain in BPES.

22336067|t|[Mutation analysis of FOXL2 gene in Chinese patients with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome].
22336067|a|OBJECTIVE: To analyse mutational points of FOXL2 gene in 5 Chinese patients with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) and to predict structural changes of the mutational FOXL2 protein. So as to improve the diagnostic accuracy of this kind of disease. METHODS: Five milliliter samples of peripheral venous blood were collected from the patients.Genomic DNA was extracted from each sample. Three pairs of PCR primers which were used to amplify the exon of FOXL2 gene were designed. After PCR process, the products were analyzed by direct genomic sequencing. RESULTS: The same c. 672_701dup30 (p. Ala224_Ala234dup) heterozygous mutation was detected from two different families. c.655C > T (p.Q219X), c.370 A > G (p. K124E) and c.858_874dup17 (p.P292fs) heterozygous mutations were detected from the other 3 sporadic cases. CONCLUSIONS: Two novel heterozygous mutations in FOXL2 (c.370A > G, c.858_874dup17) which were detected from Chinese BPES patients expand the worldwide mutational spectrum of FOXL2 gene. Being detected from two different families we confirm c. 672_701dup30 heterozygous mutation as a mutation hotspot in China.

22544055|t|Discovery of novel protein partners of the transcription factor FOXL2 provides insights into its physiopathological roles.
22544055|a|FOXL2 transcription factor is responsible for the Blepharophimosis Ptosis Epicantus inversus Syndrome (BPES), a genetic disease involving craniofacial malformations often associated with ovarian failure. Recently, a somatic FOXL2 mutation (p.C134W) has been reported in >95% of adult-type granulosa cell tumors. Here, we have identified 10 novel FOXL2 partners by yeast-two-hybrid screening and co-immunoprecipitation. Most BPES-inducing mutated FOXL2 proteins display aggregation in cultured cells. Here, we show that two of the partners (NR2C1 and GMEB1) can be sequestered in such aggregates. This co-aggregation can contribute to the pathogenesis of FOXL2 mutations. We have also measured the effects of FOXL2 interactants on the transcriptional regulation of a series of target promoters. Some of the partners (CXXC4, CXXC5, BANF1) were able to repress FOXL2 activity indistinctively of the promoter. Interestingly, CREM-tau2alpha, which acted as a repressor on most promoters, increased wild-type (WT) FOXL2 activity on two promoters (PTGS2 and CYP19A1), but was unable to increase the activity of the oncogenic mutant p.C134W. Conversely, GMEB1, which also acted as a repressor on most promoters and increased WT FOXL2 activity on the Per2 promoter, increased to a greater extent the activity of the p.C134W variant. Interestingly, partners with intrinsic pro-apoptotic effect were able to increase apoptosis induction by WT FOXL2, but not by the p.C134W mutant, whereas partners with an anti-apoptotic effect decreased apoptosis induction by both FOXL2 versions. Altogether, these results suggest that the p.C134W mutated form fails to integrate signals through protein-protein interactions to regulate target promoter subsets and in particular to induce cell death.

22835816|t|A new method of medial epicanthoplasty for patients with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome.
22835816|a|PURPOSE: To describe a medial epicanthoplasty technique using the skin redraping method and review the surgical outcome in patients with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES). DESIGN: Retrospective, noncomparative, interventional case series with the description of a new surgical technique. PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen consecutive Asian patients with BPES. METHODS: The charts of patients with BPES who underwent medial epicanthoplasty using the skin redraping method were reviewed retrospectively. Preoperative and postoperative inner intercanthal distance (IICD), interpupillary distance (IPD), horizontal palpebral fissure length (HPFL), and visibility of the scar were measured. The ratio of the IICD to IPD (IICD ratio) was calculated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Postoperative improvement in IICD ratio and the visibility of the surgical scar. RESULTS: The preoperative median IICD ratio was 1.65 (range, 1.49-1.83) and decreased to 1.27 (range, 1.02-1.48) postoperatively. The median reduction in IICD ratio was 21.7% (range, 16.7%-38.2%) (P<0.001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Fourteen patients (87.5%) had no visible scarring or scarring only visible under close inspection. Two patients (12.5%) had a more apparent scar, but no patient had severe scarring that required revision. CONCLUSIONS: Medial epicanthoplasty using the skin redraping method is an effective technique in the treatment of epicanthus inversus and telecanthus in patients with BPES, with excellent cosmetic outcomes.

22887799|t|BPES with atypical premature ovarian insufficiency, and evidence of mitotic recombination, in a woman with trisomy X and a translocation t(3;11)(q22.3;q14.1).
22887799|a|Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by a complex dysgenesis of the eyelids and premature ovarian insufficiency. FOXL2 located at 3q22.3, encoding a forkhead transcription factor, is the only gene known to be responsible for BPES. We describe a patient diagnosed with BPES with atypical ovarian failure, characterized by normal levels of gonadotropins, who was found to have trisomy X as well as a translocation (3;11)(q22.3;q14.1). The translocation breakpoint at 3q22.3 is located upstream of the FOXL2 gene and most likely causes BPES by separating the FOXL2 transcription unit from its cis-regulatory sequences. By array analysis we detected mosaicism for the balanced and an unbalanced form of the translocation in blood cells. We propose mitotic recombination as the likely mechanism of the mosaicism formation. Mitotic recombination is a common phenomenon in human cells. Thus, we hypothesize that it may be one of the mechanisms responsible for cryptic imbalances and possible abnormal phenotypes in some carriers of balanced rearrangements.

22906557|t|Blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus syndrome with translocation and deletion at chromosome 3q23 in a black African female.
22906557|a|Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder whose main features are the abnormal shape, position and alignment of the eyelids. Type I refers to BPES with female infertility from premature ovarian failure while type II is limited to the ocular features. A causative gene, FOXL2, has been localized to 3q23. We report a black female who carried a de novo chromosomal translocation and 3.13 Mb deletion at 3q23, 1.2 Mb 5' to FOXL2. This suggests the presence of distant cis regulatory elements at the extended FOXL2 locus. In spite of 21 protein coding genes in the 3.13 Mb deleted segment, the patient had no other malformation and a strictly normal psychomotor development at age 2.5 years. Our observation confirms panethnicity of BPES and adds to the knowledge of the complex cis regulation of human FOXL2 gene expression.

22926839|t|The combination of polyalanine expansion mutation and a novel missense substitution in transcription factor FOXL2 leads to different ovarian phenotypes in blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) patients.
22926839|a|STUDY QUESTION: What are the implications of multiple alterations of the forkhead box L2 (FOXL2) gene in blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) patients? SUMMARY ANSWER: A multi-mutation of FOXL2, consisting of the expansion of the polyalanine tract from 14 to 24 residues (FOXL2-Ala24), an novel Y186C substitution from c.557A>G, and a synonymous variant (c.505G>A), had a cumulative effect on ovarian phenotypes in BPES patients. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Mutations in FOXL2, a gene encoding a forkhead transcription factor cause BPES. Overall, the expansion of the polyalanine tract of FOXL2 from 14 to 24 residues (FOXL2-Ala24) accounts for 30% of intragenic mutations. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: In this study, patients from seven BPES families and six sporadic cases were included. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: We conducted an extensive clinical, hormonal and functional study in 20 patients carrying the expansion of the polyalanine tract of FOXL2 associated with BPES. A multi-mutation of FOXL2 was detected in one BPES family that showed more severe BPES symptoms. Subcellular localization and transactivation studies were performed for the constructs of FOXL2-Ala24, Y186C and FOXL2-Ala24-Y186C. MAIN RESULTS: We described the first multi-mutation of FOXL2 (c. [672_701dup30; 557A>G]) that leads to the polyalanine expansion of +10 residues (FOXL2-Ala24) combined with an Y186C substitution and a synonymous variant in a Chinese BPES family. This multi-mutation genotype was associated with more serious BPES clinical manifestations and the development of esotropia in the right eye. In in vitro studies, the multi-mutation affected the function of FOKL2 on the StAR promoter and DK3, and induced more aggressive aggregation and mislocalization of FOXL2 protein. The synonymous variant, while not affecting amino acid coding, causes a change in the RNA stem-loop structure. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The multi-mutation of FOXL2 was detected in one BPES family and it needs to be validated further by more BPES subjects. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The results of our study contribute new insights into the research field of BPES caused by the multi-mutation of FOXL2.

23084143|t|Wakayama Symposium: Notch-FoxL2-alpha-SMA axis in eyelid levator muscle development and congenital blepharophimosis.
23084143|a|This review summarizes our recent findings regarding the Notch signaling pathway in regulating normal eyelid morphogenesis and its role in the pathogenesis of human congenital blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES). We used genetic and molecular biological approaches to investigate the mechanism by which Notch1 activation controls expression of FoxL2, which in turn activates smooth muscle actin gene expression in periocular mesenchyma to control eyelid levator smooth muscle formation.

23441113|t|Genetic analysis of the forkhead transcriptional factor 2 gene in three Chinese families with blepharophimosis syndrome.
23441113|a|PURPOSE: Clinically, blepharophimosis syndrome (BPES) has been divided into two subsets according to the association of ocular malformation with (type I) or without (type II) premature ovarian failure (POF). BPES is ascribed to mutations in the forkhead transcriptional factor 2 (FOXL2) gene. This study aimed at identifying clinical features and mutations within the FOXL2 gene in three Chinese families with BPES. METHODS: A clinical and molecular genetic investigation was performed in affected and unaffected members from three Chinese families with BPES. Genomic DNA was prepared from leucocytes of peripheral venous blood, the entire coding region of FOXL2 were amplified with PCR, and direct DNA sequencing of the PCR products was performed for mutations in FOXL2. RESULTS: Three mutations in FOXL2 were found in three families, including c.672_701dup30, c.663_692dup30, and c.475dupC. Of the three, the c.475dupC (p.His159fs) was novel in family C and resulted in a frameshift mutation to generate a truncated protein owing to a premature stop codon at codon 238. The new duplication mutation was associated with BPES type II. The c.672_701dup30 (p.Ala224_Ala234dup10) and the c.663_692dup30 (p.Ala221_Ala231dup10) were detected in family A and family B, respectively, leading to expansions of the polyalanine (poly-Ala) tract that is frequently the hot spot of mutations within FOXL2. CONCLUSIONS: Our results expand the spectrum of FOXL2 mutations, and further indicate the association of a novel duplication mutation leading to a truncated protein with BPES type II. The other two known mutations may support the previous hypothesis regarding expansions of the polyalanine tract associated with BPES type II as a mutational hot spot in FOXL2.

23513057|t|Clinical, radiologic, and genetic features in blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome in the Indian population.
23513057|a|PURPOSE: To study the clinical, radiologic, and genetic features in Indian Blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) patients. METHODS: A total of 33 clinically well characterized BPES cases who presented between 2009 to 2011 were recruited. Clinical evaluation consisted of ophthalmic and orthoptic examination. For orbital indices, computed tomography (CT) scan of orbits was performed. Genetic studies included cytogenetic analysis and molecular analysis of FOXL2 gene. RESULTS: Significant clinical findings included a high incidence of refractive error in 94%, amblyopia in 60%, and strabismus in 40% of BPES cases. Orbital radiologic indices on CT scan in BPES were found to be comparable to the control group. On karyotyping, 8 out of 33 (24%) cases harbored chromosomal abnormalities. These abnormalities included 46,XY;del(3qter), 46,XY;del(3q26.3), 46,XX;del(3q24-25), and 46,XY;del(3q26qter). On molecular analysis, a novel mutation consisting of heterozygous substitution at c1635 that replaced cytosine by thymidine was detected. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on clinical features in BPES patients of Indian origin. A high incidence of refractive error, strabismus, and amblyopia was found in BPES cases. Orbital imaging confirmed that clinical features are limited to soft tissue abnormalities, with no underlying bony changes. Cytogenetic studies showed that most chromosomal abnormalities in the Indian population are in the region of the long arm of chromosome 3. Results of molecular analysis indicate that there may be loci other than the FOXL2 gene, which are affected in BPES cases. Our study expands the existing mutation spectrum of FOXL2 gene.

23516377|t|Microhomology-mediated mechanisms underlie non-recurrent disease-causing microdeletions of the FOXL2 gene or its regulatory domain.
23516377|a|Genomic disorders are often caused by recurrent copy number variations (CNVs), with nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR) as the underlying mechanism. Recently, several microhomology-mediated repair mechanisms--such as microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ), fork stalling and template switching (FoSTeS), microhomology-mediated break-induced replication (MMBIR), serial replication slippage (SRS), and break-induced SRS (BISRS)--were described in the etiology of non-recurrent CNVs in human disease. In addition, their formation may be stimulated by genomic architectural features. It is, however, largely unexplored to what extent these mechanisms contribute to rare, locus-specific pathogenic CNVs. Here, fine-mapping of 42 microdeletions of the FOXL2 locus, encompassing FOXL2 (32) or its regulatory domain (10), serves as a model for rare, locus-specific CNVs implicated in genetic disease. These deletions lead to blepharophimosis syndrome (BPES), a developmental condition affecting the eyelids and the ovary. For breakpoint mapping we used targeted array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), quantitative PCR (qPCR), long-range PCR, and Sanger sequencing of the junction products. Microhomology, ranging from 1 bp to 66 bp, was found in 91.7% of 24 characterized breakpoint junctions, being significantly enriched in comparison with a random control sample. Our results show that microhomology-mediated repair mechanisms underlie at least 50% of these microdeletions. Moreover, genomic architectural features, like sequence motifs, non-B DNA conformations, and repetitive elements, were found in all breakpoint regions. In conclusion, the majority of these microdeletions result from microhomology-mediated mechanisms like MMEJ, FoSTeS, MMBIR, SRS, or BISRS. Moreover, we hypothesize that the genomic architecture might drive their formation by increasing the susceptibility for DNA breakage or promote replication fork stalling. Finally, our locus-centered study, elucidating the etiology of a large set of rare microdeletions involved in a monogenic disorder, can serve as a model for other clustered, non-recurrent microdeletions in genetic disease.

23968369|t|One-stage correction of blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome using a frontalis muscle transfer technique.
23968369|a|Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus (BPES) is a rare genetic disease involving a complex eyelid malformation. The surgical treatment approach for BPES is highly complex and a subject of controversy. This study reports the results of a one-stage frontalis muscle transfer technique to correct BPES. This retrospective, interventional study included 21 patients with BPES who had been followed-up for a minimum of 1 year. The one-stage intervention was a combination of three surgical techniques: Mustarde medial canthoplasty, Fox lateral canthoplasty, and the frontalis muscle transfer technique. Preoperative and postoperative measurements of the horizontal lid fissure length (HLFL), vertical lid fissure width (VLFW), inner intercanthal distance (IICD), and the IICD/HLFL ratio were analyzed by Wilcoxon's signed rank test. The mean preoperative measurements were 4.73 +- 0.32 mm for VLFW, 19.98 +- 3.74 mm for HLFL, 40.85 +- 4.46 mm for IICD, and 2.11 +- 0.45 mm for the IICD/HLFL ratio. The mean postoperative measurements were 7.86 +- 0.41 mm for VLFW, 24.47 +- 3.35 mm for HLFL, 32.52 +- 4.16 mm for IICD, and 1.35 +- 0.22 mm for the IICD/HLFL ratio (p < 0.0001 for all preoperative vs postoperative values). Postoperative complications included eyelid fold deformities, lagophthalmos, and conspicuous scars. Most of these complications gradually resolved. One-stage correction of BPES is safe and efficient with the surgical techniques described.

24030029|t|A novel insertion in the FOXL2 gene in a Chilean patient with blepharophimosis ptosis epicanthus inversus syndrome type I.
24030029|a|OBJECTIVE: A novel insertion in the forkhead transcription factor 2 (FOXL2) was identified in a Chilean patient with blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome associated with premature ovarian failure (BPES type I). A clinical and molecular characterization of a patient with BPES type I was performed. METHOD: We present a 16-year-old adolescent girl with surgically treated blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus that was associated with delayed puberty and secondary amenorrhea at the age of 15, indicators that suggested that the patient had BPES type I. The FOXL2 gene was analyzed by sequencing its coding region. RESULTS: The sequence analysis of the FOXL2 gene revealed a novel heterozygous mutation: an 11 bp duplication (c.901_911dup11) that was predicted to encode a truncated protein (p.Pro305Argfs*54). CONCLUSIONS: A novel out-of-frame duplication following the polyalanine domain in the FOXL2 gene was identified in a Chilean patient with BPES type I. This study characterized the molecular alterations in FOXL2 and confirmed the diagnosis, thereby providing information to allow for improved genetic counseling for the patient and her family.

24117448|t|Base-pairing energies of proton-bound homodimers determined by guided ion beam tandem mass spectrometry: application to cytosine and 5-substituted cytosines.
24117448|a|Base-pairing interactions in proton-bound dimers of cytosine (C(+) C) are the major forces responsible for stabilization of DNA i-motif conformations. Permethylation of cytosine in extended (CCG) (CGG)n trinucleotide repeats has been shown to cause fragile-X syndrome, the most widespread inherited cause of mental retardation in humans. Oligonucleotides containing 5-bromo- or 5-fluorocytosine can bind to proteins that selectively bind methylated DNA, suggesting that halogenated cytosine damage products can potentially mimic methylation signals. However, the influence of methylation or halogenation on the base-pairing energies (BPEs) of proton-bound dimers of cytosine and their impact on the stability of DNA i-motif conformations is presently unknown. To address this, proton-bound homodimers of cytosine and 5-methyl-, 5-fluoro-, 5-bromo-, and 5-iodocytosine are investigated in detail both experimentally and theoretically. The BPEs of proton-bound homodimers of cytosine and the modified cytosines are measured by threshold collision-induced dissociation (TCID) techniques. 5-Methylation of cytosine is found to increase the BPE and would therefore tend to stabilize DNA i-motif conformations. In contrast, 5-halogenation lowers the BPE. However, the BPEs of the proton-bound 5-halocytosine homodimers examined here still significantly exceed that of Watson-Crick G C base pairs, such that DNA i-motif conformations should be preserved in the presence of these modifications. Excellent agreement between TCID measured and B3LYP calculated BPEs is found, suggesting that B3LYP calculations can be used to provide reliable energetic predictions for related systems.

24164792|t|A modified staged surgical intervention for blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome: 125 cases with encouraging results.
24164792|a|BACKGROUND: Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a rare autosomal dominant condition characterized by typical eyelid malformations that include blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus, and telecanthus. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 125 consecutive BPES patients who underwent staged surgical intervention from July 2003 to December 2011. All patients underwent initial medial and lateral canthoplasties, followed by blephroptosis correction 6 to 12 months afterward. The parameters that were studied included horizontal palpebral fissure length (PFL), vertical interpalpebral fissure height, inner intercanthal distance (IICD), the ratio of IICD to PFL, and frontalis function (FF). Facial photographs were taken preoperatively and postoperatively. Paired and group t tests were used for statistical analysis to evaluate surgical outcomes. RESULTS: After consecutive operations, the mean PFL increased from 19.5 to 25.7 mm (mean difference, 6.2 mm; P < 0.01). The mean interpalpebral fissure height increased from 3.4 to 8.5 mm (mean difference, 5.1 mm; P < 0.01). The mean IICD decreased from 38.0 to 30.9 mm (mean difference, 7.1 mm; P < 0.01). The mean FF was 7.3 mm for BPES patients approximately 5 years old and 10.4 mm for patients approximately 7 years old. There was no difference between children who underwent muscle flap suspension and healthy children of the same age (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The modified staged surgical intervention, including Y-V flap, von Ammon, and frontalis muscle flap suspension, provided effective results both in function and cosmesis for BPES. The FF was not weakened by surgery.

24240106|t|Differential apoptotic and proliferative activities of wild-type FOXL2 and blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES)-associated mutant FOXL2 proteins.
24240106|a|FOXL2 is an essential transcription factor that is required for proper development of the ovary and eyelid. Mutations in FOXL2 cause an autosomal dominant genetic disorder, blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES). BPES type I patients have eyelid malformation and premature ovarian failure leading to infertility, whereas women with type II BPES are fertile or subfertile. In the present study, we evaluated and compared apoptotic and antiproliferative activities of wild-type (WT) and mutant FOXL2 proteins found in BPES type I and II in human granulosa cell tumor-derived KGN cells. Ectopic expression of WT FOXL2 induced apoptosis and inhibited cell cycle progression in human granulosa cells. In contrast, mutated FOXL2s found in BPES type I significantly reduced these activities, whereas mutated FOXL2s in BPES type II showed intermediate activities. Furthermore, mutant FOX L2 proteins were defective in activating transcription of target genes including Caspase 8, TNF-R1, FAS, p21, and BMP4, which regulate apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation of granulosa cells. Thus, decreased apoptotic and antiproliferative activities caused by mutant forms of FOXL2 found in BPES patients may at least partially contribute to the pathophysiology of ovarian dysfunction.

24320604|t|Base-pairing energies of proton-bound heterodimers of cytosine and modified cytosines: implications for the stability of DNA i-motif conformations.
24320604|a|The DNA i-motif conformation was discovered in (CCG) (CGG)n trinucleotide repeats, which are associated with fragile X syndrome, the most widespread inherited cause of mental retardation in humans. The DNA i-motif is a four-stranded structure whose strands are held together by proton-bound dimers of cytosine (C(+) C). The stronger base-pairing interactions in C(+) C proton-bound dimers as compared to Watson-Crick G C base pairs are the major forces responsible for stabilization of i-motif conformations. Methylation of cytosine results in silencing of the FMR1 gene and causes fragile X syndrome. However, the influence of methylation or other modifications such as halogenation of cytosine on the base-pairing energies (BPEs) in the i-motif remains elusive. To address this, proton-bound heterodimers of cytosine and 5-methylcytosine, 5-fluorocytosine, 5-bromocytosine, and 5-iodocytosine are probed in detail. Experimentally, the BPEs of proton-bound heterodimers of cytosine and modified cytosines are determined using threshold collision-induced dissociation (TCID) techniques. All modifications at the 5-position of cytosine are found to lower the BPE and therefore would tend to destabilize DNA i-motif conformations. However, the BPEs in these proton-bound heterodimers still significantly exceed those of the Watson-Crick G C and neutral C C base pairs, suggesting that C(+) C mismatches are still energetically favored such that i-motif conformations are preserved. Excellent agreement between TCID measured BPEs and B3LYP calculated values is found with the def2-TZVPPD and 6-311+G(2d,2p) basis sets, suggesting that calculations at these levels of theory can be employed to provide reliable energetic predictions for related systems.

24458743|t|An individual with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) and additional features expands the phenotype associated with mutations in KAT6B.
24458743|a|Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in FOXL2. We identified an individual with BPES and additional phenotypic features who did not have a FOXL2 mutation. We used whole exome sequencing to identify a de novo mutation in KAT6B (lysine acetyltransferase 6B) in this individual. The mutation was a 2-bp insertion leading to a frameshift which resulted in a premature stop codon. The resulting truncated protein does not have the C-terminal serine/methionine transcription activation domain necessary for interaction with other transcriptional and epigenetic regulators. This mutation likely has a dominant-negative or gain-of-function effect, similar to those observed in other genetic disorders resulting from KAT6B mutations, including Say-Barber-Biesecker-Young-Simpson (SBBYSS) and genitopatellar syndrome (GTPTS). Thus, our subject's phenotype broadens the spectrum of clinical findings associated with mutations in KAT6B. Furthermore, our results suggest that individuals with BPES without a FOXL2 mutation should be tested for KAT6B mutations. The transcriptional and epigenetic regulation mediated by KAT6B appears crucial to early developmental processes, which when perturbed can lead to a wide spectrum of phenotypic outcomes.

24565867|t|A piggyBac insertion disrupts Foxl2 expression that mimics BPES syndrome in mice.
24565867|a|Blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by small palpebral fissures and other craniofacial malformations, often with (type I) but could also without (type II) premature ovarian failure. While mutations of the forkhead transcription factor FOXL2 are associated with and likely be responsible for many BPES cases, how FOXL2 affects craniofacial development remain to be understood. Through a large-scale piggyBac (PB) insertion mutagenesis, we have identified a mouse mutant carrying a PB insertion ~160 kb upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) of Foxl2. The insertion reduces, but not eliminates, the expression of Foxl2. This mutant, but not its revertant, displays BPES-like conditions such as midface hypoplasia, eyelid abnormalities and female subfertility. Further analysis indicates that the mutation does not affect mandible, but causes premature fusion of the premaxilla-maxilla suture, smaller premaxilla and malformed maxilla during midface development. We further identified an evolutionarily conserved fragment near the insertion site and observed enhancer activity of this element in tissue culture cells. Analyses using DNase I hypersensitivity assay and chromosome conformation capture assay in developing maxillary and periocular tissues suggest that the DNA region near the insertion site likely interacts with Foxl2 TSS. Therefore, this mutant presents an excellent animal model for mechanistic study of BPES and regulation of Foxl2.

There is no data to guide the treatment of these patients when presenting with infertility. CASE: A 30-year-old, nulligravid woman with premature ovarian insufficiency associated with BPES type I presented to care secondary to a desire to conceive. Ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins was performed, and the patient conceived and delivered viable twins. CONCLUSION: It is not known whether premature ovarian insufficiency associated with BPES type I follows the same clinical course as idiopathic premature ovarian insufficiency. In patients with BPES type I who present with infertility, ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins may be a reasonable therapeutic option.

24722273|a|Blepharophimosis ptosis epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a complex eyelid malformation characterized by the classical tetrad of blepharophimosis, telecanthus, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus. It has been reported to be associated with other ocular anomalies such as euryblepharon, strabismus, nystagmus, amblyopia, microphthalmos, lacrimal drainage apparatus abnormality, extra ocular muscle abnormalities, microcornea, trabecular dysgenesis, optic nerve hypoplasias, and colobomas of the optic disk. We describe a case of BPES with Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome, a neurocristopathy characterized by maldevelopment of the anterior segment with predisposition to development of glaucoma. Interestingly, both syndromes are caused by mutations in the same class of genes, namely the winged-helix/forked transcription factors (FOX) involved in a variety of developmental processes.

A 9-month-old boy presented with characteristic clinical findings of BPES confirmed by genetic testing. On further history taking and evaluation, the patient was noted to have no tear production, despite clinically present palpebral lobes of the lacrimal glands. BPES is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by narrowed horizontal palpebral fissures, severe bilateral symmetric ptosis, epicanthus inversus, and telecanthus. To the authors' knowledge, this represents the second reported case of congenital alacrima in this syndrome. The first case described in the literature was in a 9-month-old girl who had congenital absence of the lacrimal glands. BPES may present with alacrima requiring vigilant lifelong lubrication and careful consideration in decisions for eyelid surgery including ptosis repair.

24817949|t|FOXL2 suppresses proliferation, invasion and promotes apoptosis of cervical cancer cells.
24817949|a|FOXL2 is a transcription factor that is essential for ovarian function and maintenance, the germline mutations of which give rise to the blepharophimosis ptosis epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES), often associated with premature ovarian failure. Recently, its mutations have been found in ovarian granulosa cell tumors (OGCTs). In this study, we measured the expression of FOXL2 in cervical cancer by immunohistochemistry and its mRNA level in cervical cancer cell lines Hela and Siha by RT-PCR. Then we overexpressed FOXL2 in Hela cells and silenced it in Siha cells by plasmid transfection and verified using western blotting. When FOXL2 was overexpressed or silenced, cells proliferation and apoptosis were determined by Brdu assay and Annexin V/PI detection kit, respectively. In addition, we investigated the effects of FOXL2 on the adhesion and invasion of Hela and Siha cells. Finally, we analyzed the influences of FOXL2 on Ki67, PCNA and FasL by flow cytometry. The results showed that FOXL2 was highly expressed in cervical squamous cancer. Overexpressing FOXL2 suppressed Hela proliferation and facilitated its apoptosis. Silencing FOXL2 enhanced Siha proliferation and inhibited its apoptosis. Meanwhile, silencing FOXL2 promoted Siha invasion, but it had no effect on cells adhesion. In addition, overexpressing FOXL2 decreased the expression of Ki67 in Hela and Siha cells. Therefore, our results suggested that FOXL2 restrained cells proliferation and enhanced cells apoptosis mainly through decreasing Ki67 expression.

25086333|t|Intragenic and extragenic disruptions of FOXL2 mapped by whole genome low-coverage sequencing in two BPES families with chromosome reciprocal translocation.
25086333|a|Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder that affects craniofacial development and ovarian function. FOXL2 is the only gene known to be responsible for BPES. The majority of BPES patients show intragenic mutations of FOXL2. Recently, a 7.4 kb sequence disruption, which was 283 kb upstream of FOXL2, was identified to independently contribute to the BPES phenotype. Several breakpoints nearing FOXL2 (0 Mb to 1.2 Mb, several of which were distant from the 7.4 kb sequence disruption) have been mapped or deduced through a traditional method in BPES patients with chromosome reciprocal translocation. In this study, two BPES families with chromosome reciprocal translocation were investigated. Intragenic mutations of FOXL2 or pathogenic copy number variations were excluded for the two BPES families. All of the four breakpoints were identified at a base-precise manner using Giemsa banding and whole genome low-coverage sequencing (WGLCS). In family 01, the breakpoints were found at chr1:95,609,998 and chr3:138,879, 114 (213,132 bp upstream of FOXL2). In family 02, the breakpoints were located at chr3:138,665,431 (intragenic disruptions of FOXL2) and chr20:56,924,609. Results indicate that the intragenic and extragenic interruptions of FOXL2 can be accurately and rapidly detected using WGLCS. In addition, both the 213 kb upstream and intragenic interruptions of FOXL2 can cause BPES phenotype.

25180952|t|Cosmetic Comparison Between the Modified Uchida Method and the Mustarde Method for Blepharophimosis-Ptosis-Epicanthus Inversus Syndrome.
25180952|a|PURPOSE: Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a rare, congenital, surgically challenging disease. We undertook an objective, functional, and cosmetic comparison between the modified Uchida procedure and the Mustarde procedure on Asian patients with BPES. DESIGN: This is a retrospective, comparative, interventional case series with the description of 2 surgical techniques. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty consecutive Japanese patients with BPES were studied. METHODS: The patients were assigned to either the modified Uchida or the Mustarde procedure on the basis of preoperative intercanthal distance (ICD) ratio (ICD/palpebral fissure width). Intercanthal distance and margin reflex distance were measured from photographs before and after surgery. Classifications were made according to epicanthal fold score and cosmetic score using a visual analog scale (VAS). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures were postoperative improvement in ICD ratio and the VAS. RESULTS: Of the 20 patients, 5 underwent the modified Uchida procedure and the other 15 underwent the Mustarde procedure. The preoperative median ICD ratio was 2.0 (range, 1.9-2.5) and 2.5 (range, 2.0-3.4) for the modified Uchida and Mustarde procedures, respectively, and decreased to 1.5 (range, 1.5-1.7) and 1.6 (range, 1.5-1.8) postoperatively. The mean ICD reduction rate was 35.7% (SD, 1.0%) in the Mustarde group and 22.1% (SD, 1.3%) in the modified Uchida group (P < 0.001).The mean VAS for the modified Uchida and Mustarde procedures was 5.9 (SD, 1.3) and 2.8 (SD, 1.1), respectively, which was statistically significant (P = 0.0166). CONCLUSIONS: Both the modified Uchida and Mustarde procedures could effectively shorten the ICD; however, cosmetic results were significantly superior using the modified Uchida method.

25192944|t|Co-occurrence of congenital hydronephrosis and FOXL2-associated blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES).
25192944|a|Blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is an autosomal dominantly inherited congenital malformation of the eyelids. Diagnostic criteria include blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus and telecanthus. Type I BPES has additional features of premature ovarian failure and female infertility, while type II occurs isolated. We report a two-year old male child with typical features of BPES and bilateral congenital hydronephrosis. The child, first-born to non-consanguineous parents, presented to us with hypertension. Congenital hydronephrosis and reduced renal function were confirmed by renal dynamic scan. Pyeloplasty and stent placement were performed with subsequent resolution of hypertension. On follow up, growth and development are appropriate for age. His father has similar but less severe features of BPES. Sequencing of the FOXL2 gene revealed a heterozygous FOXL2 mutation c.672_701dup, which is a recurrent 30-bp duplication leading to expansion of the polyalanine tract (p.Ala225_Ala234dup), in both father and son. Additional atypical clinical features have been reported previously in BPES patients with this mutation. However, this is the first report of a renal congenital anomaly in a BPES patient with this or other mutations. Although a pleiotropic effect of the FOXL2 mutation cannot be excluded, the co-occurrence of congenital hydronephrosis and BPES may represent two different entities.

25416281|t|Etiology of craniofacial malformations in mouse models of blepharophimosis, ptosis and epicanthus inversus syndrome.
25416281|a|Blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus-inversus syndrome (BPES) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by narrow palpebral fissures and eyelid levator muscle defects. BPES is often associated to premature ovarian insufficiency (BPES type I). FOXL2, a member of the forkhead transcription factor family, is the only gene known to be mutated in BPES. Foxl2 is essential for maintenance of ovarian identity, but the developmental origin of the facial malformations of BPES remains, so far, unexplained. In this study, we provide the first detailed account of the developmental processes leading to the craniofacial malformations associated to Foxl2. We show that, during development, Foxl2 is expressed both by Cranial Neural Crest Cells (CNCCs) and by Cranial Mesodermal Cells (CMCs), which give rise to skeletal (CNCCs and CMCs) and muscular (CMCs) components of the head. Using mice in which Foxl2 is selectively inactivated in either CNCCs or CMCs, we reveal that expression of Foxl2 in CNCCs is essential for the development of extraocular muscles. Indeed, inactivation of Foxl2 in CMCs has only minor effects on muscle development, whereas its inactivation in CNCCs provokes a severe hypoplasia of the levator palpabrae superioris and of the superior and inferior oblique muscles. We further show that Foxl2 deletion in either CNCCs or CMCs prevents eyelid closure and induces subtle skeletal developmental defects. Our results provide new insights in the complex developmental origin of human BPES and could help to understand the origin of other ocular anomalies associated to this syndrome.

25565341|t|Base-pairing energies of protonated nucleobase pairs and proton affinities of 1-methylated cytosines: model systems for the effects of the sugar moiety on the stability of DNA i-motif conformations.
25565341|a|Expansion of (CCG)n (CGG)n trinucleotide repeats leads to hypermethylation of cytosine residues and results in Fragile X syndrome, the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability in humans. The (CCG)n (CGG)n repeats adopt i-motif conformations that are preferentially stabilized by base-pairing interactions of noncanonical protonated nucleobase pairs of cytosine (C(+) C). Previously, we investigated the effects of 5-methylation of cytosine on the base-pairing energies (BPEs) using threshold collision-induced dissociation (TCID) techniques. In the present work, we extend our investigations to include protonated homo- and heteronucleobase pairs of cytosine, 1-methylcytosine, 5-methylcytosine, and 1,5-dimethylcytosine. The 1-methyl substituent prevents most tautomerization processes of cytosine and serves as a mimic for the sugar moiety of DNA nucleotides. In contrast to permethylation of cytosine at the 5-position, 1-methylation is found to exert very little influence on the BPE. All modifications to both nucleobases lead to a small increase in the BPEs, with 5-methylation producing a larger enhancement than either 1-methyl or 1,5-dimethylation. In contrast, modifications to a single nucleobase are found to produce a small decrease in the BPEs, again with 5-methylation producing a larger effect than 1-methylation. However, the BPEs of all of the protonated nucleobase pairs examined here significantly exceed those of canonical G C and neutral C C base pairs, and thus should still provide the driving force stabilizing DNA i-motif conformations even in the presence of such modifications. The proton affinities of the methylated cytosines are also obtained from the TCID experiments by competitive analyses of the primary dissociation pathways that occur in parallel for the protonated heteronucleobase pairs.

25687138|t|Role of Foxl2 in uterine maturation and function.
25687138|a|Foxl2 codes for a forkhead/HNF3 transcription factor essential for follicular maturation and maintenance of ovarian identity. FOXL2 mutations are associated with Blepharophimosis, Ptosis and Epicanthus inversus Syndrome (BPES) characterized by eyelid malformations (types I and II) and premature ovarian insufficiency (type I). We show that Foxl2 is not only expressed by the ovary, but also by other components of the mouse female reproductive tract, including the uterus, the cervix and the oviduct. In the uterus, Foxl2 expression is first observed in the neonatal mesenchyme and, during uterine maturation, persists in the stroma and in the deep inner myometrial layer (IML). In the adult, Foxl2 is expressed in the differentiated stromal layer, but no longer in the myometrium. Conditional deletion of Foxl2 in the postnatal (PN) uterus using Progesterone Receptor-cre (Pgr(cre/+)) mice results in infertility. During PN uterine maturation Pgr(cre/+); Foxl2(flox/flox) mice present a severely reduced thickness of the stroma layer and an hypertrophic, disorganized IML. In adult Pgr(cre/+); Foxl2(flox/flox) mice a supplementary muscular layer is present at the stroma/myometrium border and vascular smooth muscle cells fail to form a coherent layer around uterine arteries. Wnt signalling pathways play a central role in uterine maturation; in Pgr(cre/+); Foxl2(flox/flox) mice, Wnt genes are deregulated suggesting that Foxl2 acts through these signals. In humans, thickening of the IML (also called "junctional zone") is associated with reduced fertility, endometriosis and adenomyosis. Our data suggest that Foxl2 has a crucial role in PN uterine maturation and could help to understand sub-fertility predisposition in women.

25988799|a|OBJECTIVE: This study aims to search for mutations in relevant genes in a woman with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) and blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES). METHODS: This study reports on the case of a woman with POI, BPES, and autoimmune endocrine disorder. Bidirectional sequencing of the coding regions and intron/exon boundaries of FOXL2 and BMP15 genes and hormonal assays for the measurement of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estradiol, testosterone, Delta4-androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were employed. RESULTS: A novel de novo heterozygous deletion (p.K150Rfs*121) in the FOXL2 gene was identified to coexist with two BMP15 gene variants located in the same allele (c.-9C>G; p.N103S). CONCLUSIONS: The novel, de novo FOXL2 gene mutation (p.K150Rfs*121) expands the spectrum of molecular defects identified in women with BPES. Coexisting gene variants in POI-related genes, such as BMP15, may act synergistically and explain the observed phenotypic variability in women with BPES (ie, BPES with or without POI). The concept of digenic inheritance suggested herein has been previously introduced for other nosologies such as hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism. Endocrine autoimmunity might also contribute to the POI phenotype.

26002790|t|Base-Pairing Energies of Protonated Nucleoside Base Pairs of dCyd and m(5)dCyd: Implications for the Stability of DNA i-Motif Conformations.
26002790|a|Hypermethylation of cytosine in expanded (CCG)n (CGG)n trinucleotide repeats results in Fragile X syndrome, the most common cause of inherited mental retardation. The (CCG)n (CGG)n repeats adopt i-motif conformations that are preferentially stabilized by base-pairing interactions of protonated base pairs of cytosine. Here we investigate the effects of 5-methylation and the sugar moiety on the base-pairing energies (BPEs) of protonated cytosine base pairs by examining protonated nucleoside base pairs of 2'-deoxycytidine (dCyd) and 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine (m(5)dCyd) using threshold collision-induced dissociation techniques. 5-Methylation of a single or both cytosine residues leads to very small change in the BPE. However, the accumulated effect may be dramatic in diseased state trinucleotide repeats where many methylated base pairs may be present. The BPEs of the protonated nucleoside base pairs examined here significantly exceed those of Watson-Crick dGuo dCyd and neutral dCyd dCyd base pairs, such that these base-pairing interactions provide the major forces responsible for stabilization of DNA i-motif conformations. Compared with isolated protonated nucleobase pairs of cytosine and 1-methylcytosine, the 2'-deoxyribose sugar produces an effect similar to the 1-methyl substituent, and leads to a slight decrease in the BPE. These results suggest that the base-pairing interactions may be slightly weaker in nucleic acids, but that the extended backbone is likely to exert a relatively small effect on the total BPE. The proton affinity (PA) of m(5)dCyd is also determined by competitive analysis of the primary dissociation pathways that occur in parallel for the protonated (m(5)dCyd)H(+)(dCyd) nucleoside base pair and the absolute PA of dCyd previously reported.

26043072|t|A Modified One-Stage Early Correction of Blepharophimosis Syndrome Using Tutopatch Slings.
26043072|a|PURPOSE: To investigate the efficacy of a one-stage early correction of blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES), using bovine pericardium derived membrane (TUTOPATCH( )) for the frontalis suspension. METHODS: We prospectively studied 12 eyes from 6 patients (median age 14 months) affected by BPES with severe ptosis. All patients were submitted to a one-stage early correction of ptosis (frontalis suspension with TUTOPACH( )) and telecanthus and epicanthus inversus. Upper margin reflex distance (MRD), nasal inner intercanthal distance (IICD), horizontal fissure length (HFL), and IICD/HFL ratio were evaluated using photographs. RESULTS: The Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed a statistically significant difference between pre- and post-operative MRD, IICD, HFL, and the IICD/HFL ratio. CONCLUSION: An early TUTOPATCH-assisted frontalis suspension, together with the correction of telecanthus and epicanthus inversus, is an effective procedure for BPES cases with severe ptosis.

26100530|t|Characterization of endocrine features and genotype-phenotypes correlations in blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome type 1.
26100530|a|OBJECTIVE: Blepharophimosis syndrome (BPES) is an autosomal dominant genetic condition resulting from heterozygous mutations in the FOXL2 gene and clinically characterized by an eyelid malformation associated (type I) or not (type II) with premature ovarian failure. The distinction between the two forms is critical for female patients, as it may allow to predict fertility and to plan an appropriate therapy. Identifying an underlying causative mutation is not always predictive of the clinical type of BPES since genotype-phenotype correlations are not yet fully delineated. Here, we describe the clinical and hormonal phenotypes of three female patients with BPES type 1 from two novel families, correlate their phenotypes with identified mutations, and investigate the effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). METHODS: Clinical, biochemical, and genetic evaluation were undertaken in all the patients and genotype-phenotype correlation was analyzed. The effects of substitutive hormonal therapy on secondary sexual characteristics development and induction of menarche were evaluated. RESULTS: All patients presented with primary amenorrhea or other signs of ovarian dysfunction. Two distinct mutations, a missense p.H104R change and an in-frame p.A222_A231dup10 duplication in the FOXL2 gene were identified. Observed phenotypes were not in accordance with the prediction based on the current genotype-phenotype correlations. HRT significantly improved secondary sexual characteristics development, as well as the induction of menarche. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the importance of early recognition of BPES and emphasizes the need of personalized therapy and follow-up in female patients carrying distinct FOXL2 mutations.

26134413|t|FOXL2 modulates cartilage, skeletal development and IGF1-dependent growth in mice.
26134413|a|BACKGROUND: Haploinsufficiency of the FOXL2 transcription factor in humans causes Blepharophimosis/Ptosis/Epicanthus Inversus syndrome (BPES), characterized by eyelid anomalies and premature ovarian failure. Mice lacking Foxl2 recapitulate human eyelid/forehead defects and undergo female gonadal dysgenesis. We report here that mice lacking Foxl2 also show defects in postnatal growth and embryonic bone and cartilage formation. METHODS: Foxl2 (-/-) male mice at different stages of development have been characterized and compared to wild type. Body length and weight were measured and growth curves were created. Skeletons were stained with alcian blue and/or alizarin red. Bone and cartilage formation was analyzed by Von Kossa staining and immunofluorescence using anti-FOXL2 and anti-SOX9 antibodies followed by confocal microscopy. Genes differentially expressed in skull vaults were evaluated by microarray analysis. Analysis of the GH/IGF1 pathway was done evaluating the expression of several hypothalamic-pituitary-bone axis markers by RT-qPCR. RESULTS: Compared to wild-type, Foxl2 null mice are smaller and show skeletal abnormalities and defects in cartilage and bone mineralization, with down-regulation of the GH/IGF1 axis. Consistent with these effects, we find FOXL2 expressed in embryos at 9.5 dpc in neural tube epithelium, in head mesenchyme near the neural tube, and within the first branchial arch; then, starting at 12.5 dpc, expressed in cartilaginous tissue; and at PO and P7, in hypothalamus. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support FOXL2 as a master transcription factor in a spectrum of developmental processes, including growth, cartilage and bone formation. Its action overlaps that of SOX9, though they are antagonistic in female vs male gonadal sex determination but conjoint in cartilage and skeletal development.

26148525|t|Base-Pairing Energies of Proton-Bound Dimers and Proton Affinities of 1-Methyl-5-Halocytosines: Implications for the Effects of Halogenation on the Stability of the DNA i-Motif.
26148525|a|(CCG)(n) (CGG)(n) trinucleotide repeats have been found to be associated with fragile X syndrome, the most widespread inherited cause of mental retardation in humans. The (CCG)(n) (CGG)(n) repeats adopt i-motif conformations that are preferentially stabilized by base-pairing interactions of noncanonical proton-bound dimers of cytosine (C(+) C). Halogenated cytosine residues are one form of DNA damage that may be important in altering the structure and stability of DNA or DNA-protein interactions and, hence, regulate gene expression. Previously, we investigated the effects of 5-halogenation and 1-methylation of cytosine on the base-pairing energies (BPEs) using threshold collision-induced dissociation (TCID) techniques. In the present study, we extend our work to include proton-bound homo- and heterodimers of cytosine, 1-methyl-5-fluorocytosine, and 1-methyl-5-bromocytosine. All modifications examined here are found to produce a decrease in the BPEs. However, the BPEs of all of the proton-bound dimers examined significantly exceed those of Watson-Crick G C, neutral C C base pairs, and various methylated variants such that DNA i-motif conformations should still be preserved in the presence of these modifications. The proton affinities (PAs) of the halogenated cytosines are also obtained from the experimental data by competitive analysis of the primary dissociation pathways that occur in parallel for the proton-bound heterodimers. 5-Halogenation leads to a decrease in the N3 PA of cytosine, whereas 1-methylation leads to an increase in the N3 PA. Thus, the 1-methyl-5-halocytosines exhibit PAs that are intermediate.

26323275|t|Novel FOXL2 mutations in two Chinese families with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome.
26323275|a|BACKGROUND: Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a rare autosomal dominant disease. Mutations in the forkhead box L2 (FOXL2) gene cause two types of BPES distinguished by the presence (type I) and absence (type II) of premature ovarian failure (POF). The purpose of this study was to identify possible mutations in FOXL2 in two Chinese families with BPES. METHODS: Two large autosomal dominant Chinese BPES families were enrolled in this study. Genomic DNA was obtained from the leukocytes in peripheral venous blood. Four overlapping sets of primers were used to amplify the entire coding region and nearby intron sequences of the FOXL2 gene for mutations detection using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing analyses. The sequencing results were analyzed using DNAstar software. RESULTS: All patients of the two families demonstrated typical features of BPES type II, including small palpebral fissures, ptosis, telecanthus, and epicanthus inversus without female infertility (POF). A novel FOXL2 heterozygous indel mutation c.675_690delinsT, including a 16-bp deletion and a 1-bp(T) insertion (p.Ala226_Ala230del), which would result in deletion of 5 alanine residues of a poly-alanine (poly-Ala) tract in the protein, was identified in all affected members of family A. A novel heterozygous missense mutation (c.223C > T, p.Leu75Phe) was identified in family B. CONCLUSIONS: Two novel FOXL2 mutations were identified in Chinese families with BPES. Our results expand the spectrum of FOXL2 mutations and provide additional structure-function insights into the FOXL2 protein.

BPES's main clinical manifestations is blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus, and telecanthus. BPES is a rare autosomal dominant disease caused by FOXL 2 gene mutation, sometimes associated with retarded growth, delayed development, congenital heart disease, and microcephaly. Suffering from both sensorineural hearing loss and BPES is rare in reported literature. This case is diagnosed by clinical examination, without visual impairment. Facial nerve dysplasia has been found during the surgery. For congenital deafness patients with eye disease or other diseases, timely and correct diagnosis has important clinical significance, which can improve the diagnostic rate and make it coming true to early intervention, and then, effectively improve the quality of the patients. There are few literature reports, of patients with two kinds of genetic diseases. Our inference is that the cases are rare or the patients has visited different departments and ignored the other systems' signs. Therefore, in such doubtful cases, we should do the professional comprehensive examination in daily clinical work in order to avoid missed diagnosis or delayed treatment and intervention. By analyzing this case, the patient may also suffer from facial nerve dysplasia. Preoperatively viewing CT scan and operatively facial nerve monitor being used can avoid the occurrence of surgical complications.

27081523|t|A novel FOXL2 mutation in a Chinese family with blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus syndrome.
27081523|a|Blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disease characterized by a narrowed horizontal palpehral aperture, ptosis, epicanthus inversus and telecanthus with or without premature ovarian failure. Mutations in the forkhead transcription factor 2 (FOXL2) have been shown to be responsible for BPES. We performed direct sequencing of the FOXL2 gene for molecular investigation of a Chinese family with BPES. A novel duplication mutation (c.858_868dup), resulting in a truncated protein, was detected.

27283035|t|Analysis of FOXL2 detects three novel mutations and an atypical phenotype of blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome.
27283035|a|BACKGROUND: Mutations in FOXL2 are known to cause autosomal dominant blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES), variably associated with premature ovarian failure. In this study, we report results of mutational screening in a Czech and Slovak patient population with BPES. DESIGN: Case series. PARTICIPANTS: Thirteen probands of Czech and one proband of Slovak origin with BPES and their available family members. METHODS: Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification in 14 probands with BPES. Targeted mutational screening in first-degree relatives. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Genetic characterization and phenotype evaluation in Czech and Slovak individuals with BPES and their family members. RESULTS: Eight different mutations were detected including three novel ones: c.5T>G; p.(Met2Arg), c.197C>A; p.(Ala66Glu) and c.701_702insTGCAGCCGCAGCGGCTGCAGCAGCTGCGGCTGCAGCCGC; p.(Ala222_Ala234dup). In one family, the molecular genetic cause of disease was not identified by the methodology used. In 13 pedigrees, a negative family history suggested a de novo origin, which could be confirmed by targeted mutational screening in four families. One 62-year-old female with the c.663_692dup30 mutation had an atypical phenotype presenting as moderate ptosis compensated by frontalis muscle contraction, no epicanthus inversus and no premature ovarian failure. CONCLUSIONS: The de novo mutation rate in FOXL2 is exceptionally high compared with other dominant disorders manifesting with an ocular phenotype. In cases reporting a negative family history, careful examination of both parents is important to exclude mild features of the BPES phenotype.

27414805|t|FOXL2 Is an Essential Activator of SF-1-Induced Transcriptional Regulation of Anti-Mullerian Hormone in Human Granulosa Cells.
27414805|a|Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) is required for proper sexual differentiation by regulating the regression of the Mullerian ducts in males. Recent studies indicate that AMH could be an important factor for maintaining the ovarian reserve. However, the mechanisms of AMH regulation in the ovary are largely unknown. Here, we provide evidence that AMH is an ovarian target gene of steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), an orphan nuclear receptor required for proper follicle development. FOXL2 is an evolutionally conserved transcription factor, and its mutations cause blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES), wherein affected females display eyelid defects and premature ovarian failure (POF). Notably, we found that functional FOXL2 is essential for SF-1-induced AMH regulation, via protein-protein interactions between FOXL2 and SF-1. A BPES-inducing mutant of FOXL2 (290-291delCA) was unable to interact with SF-1 and failed to mediate the association between SF-1 and the AMH promoter. Therefore, this study identified a novel regulatory circuit for ovarian AMH production; specifically, through the coordinated interplay between FOXL2 and SF-1 that could control ovarian follicle development.

27488160|t|Unilateral anterior persistent fetal vasculature in a child with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome: A surgical challenge.
27488160|a|Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disease. It is clinically characterized by four major features; blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus, and telecanthus. We report a case of a 1-year-old female with BPES with unilateral anterior persistent fetal vasculature (PFV). On examination, she was found to have all the clinical features of BPES, along with calcified and partially absorbed cataract with elongated ciliary processes in her left eye. B-scan of left eye showed attached retina with no evidence of posterior PFV. Systemic examination was normal. She underwent cataract surgery with primary posterior capsulotomy with intraocular lens implantation under general anesthesia. Literature search did not reveal any previous reports of unilateral anterior PFV and BPES. The clinical features, other associations, and the difficulties in the surgical management of this condition are discussed.

27914838|t|Lacrimal Gland Involvement in Blepharophimosis-Ptosis-Epicanthus Inversus Syndrome.
27914838|a|PURPOSE: To describe the involvement of the lacrimal gland (LG) in blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES). DESIGN: Observational, cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-one patients with BPES (10 female, 11 male) aged on average 15 years (range, 2-39 years), from 3 Brazilian medical centers and 1 Portuguese medical center. METHODS: Patients had their ocular surface evaluated with slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and tear production quantified with the Schirmer test I. The LG volumes were measured on computed tomography (CT) scans in the BPES sample and in a group of age-matched subjects imaged for nonorbital diseases. Sixteen patients were screened for mutations in the FOXL2 gene. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Lacrimal meniscus height, Schirmer test I, presence of superficial punctate keratopathy (SPK), LG volume, and molecular analysis of the FOXL2 gene. RESULTS: Absence of LG was detected bilaterally in 9 patients (42.8%) and unilaterally in 2 patients (9.5%). When considering only patients with measurable LG, the median volume was 0.22 cm3 in the right eye (range, 0.06-0.36 cm3) and 0.24 cm3 in the left eye (range, 0.08-0.34 cm3). These values were significantly lower than those for the age-matched controls (median = 0.54 right eye and 0.53 left eye; P < 0.05). There was a significant association between deficiency of tear production and LG volume reduction and agenesis. Molecular analysis of the FOXL2 gene revealed the presence of 8 distinct mutations, 4 of them novel ones. A significant reduction of LG size or agenesis was associated with mutations affecting protein size (due to underlying changes in the stop codon location) or the DNA-binding forkhead domain (Fisher exact test, P = 0.021). In 3 probands, the underlying genetic defect was not found. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study reporting LG volumes in BPES, describing a significant number of patients with LG agenesis. The association between alacrima and BPES is not incidental, and a thorough evaluation of tear production is recommended especially if ptosis surgery is planned.

28224805|a|PURPOSE: To report the ocular phenotype of blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES). METHODS: Ophthalmological examination of a 36 year-old proband and detailed family history evaluation, including assessment of available facial photographs of affected relatives, was performed. RESULTS: There were four affected males and one female in three generations. The proband underwent two surgical eyelid procedures in childhood. Upon our examination, he had symmetrical ptosis with shorter eye lids, and incomplete medial canthal closure. The skin in the inner canthi was scarred, and the medial lower lids slightly everted, leading to malapposition of lacrimal punctae. There was no epicanthus inversus, however it was impossible to determine the status prior to the eyelid surgeries. The best corrected visual acuity was 0.66 and 0.33, in the right and left eye, respectively. The rest of the ocular examination was normal. There was no strabismus. Based on inspection of photographs taken prior to eyelid surgeries, the typical signs of BPES were also present in a son and a nephew of the proband. Photographs of the affected brother were not available, but family history indicated that he had BPES and underwent in his childhood two eye lid surgeries. Atypical ocular phenotype of the probands mother has been published previously. CONCLUSIONS: Ophthalmologists need to be aware about the phenotype of BPES, with the potential for visual impairment, and the need for personalized management in the affected families.Key words: blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus, phenotype, FOXL2.

28511421|t|Surgical Outcome of Epicanthus and Telecanthus Correction by Double Z-Plasty and Trans-Nasal Fixation with Prolene Suture in Blepharophimosis Syndrome.
28511421|a|INTRODUCTION: Blepharophimosis Syndrome (BPES) is a complex and rare disease characterized by epicanthus inversus, telecanthus, lateral ectropion, narrowed or shortened inter-palpebral fissure distance and ptosis. It is mostly bilateral and may or may not be symmetrical. It is typically inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. In sporadic cases, the disease may occur without a prior family history as a genetic mutation from a deletion or translocation of the FOXL2 gene, which maps to chromosome 3q23. Surgical treatment of this disease poses an oculoplastic challenge due to multiple complex eyelid deformities. AIM: To evaluate the functional and cosmetic outcome of telecanthus and epicanthus correction by a Mustarde's rectangular double Z-Plasty and trans-nasal fixation using 1-0 prolene suture in BPES. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was prospective, interventional study of 16 patients over a period of three years. In this study, all patients had BPES with prominent epicanthus and telecanthus. Mustarde's double Z-plasty and trans-nasal fixation with 1-0 prolene suture was performed in the first of a two-stage operation. If ectropion was present, the lateral ectropion was corrected by a base-out flap transfer from the upper eyelid to the lower eyelid. After three months, a 2nd stage was undertaken, involving a lateral canthoplasty for horizontal widening of a short palpebral fissure and a tarso frontalis sling with silicone rod for correction of moderate to severe ptosis. Patients were followed up for six months to one year with postoperative ophthalmologic examinations and photographs. RESULTS: Out of 16 patients, 10 were females and six were males. All the patients had bilateral involvement. In this study preoperative Inner Intercanthal Distance (IICD) ranged from 38 mm to 42 mm and the mean IICD was 41.2+-0.57 mm. Postoperative IICD ranged from 31 mm to 34 mm. Horizontal Palpebral Fissure Length (HPFL) ranged from 20 mm to 23 mm and the mean value of HPFL was 21.50 mm preoperatively. Postoperative HPFL ranged from 26 mm to 29 mm and had a mean value of 28.50 mm, which was much improved after a combined correction of telecanthus and lateral canthoplasty. The mean preoperative IICD and HPFL ratio was 1.77 and was reduced to a postoperative value of 1.2. The Marginal Reflex Distance1 (MRD-1) test value improved from +1.25 mm to +3.50 mm postoperatively after placement of a tarsofrontalis sling with silicone rod using the Fox's Pentagon technique. In this study, two eyes had minimal unequal correction but were cosmetically and functionally acceptable. Correction of IICD is possible up to 6 mm. No major complication e.g., CSF rhinorrhea was noted in this series and preoperative prominent epicanthal folds were abolished. CONCLUSION: Here we propose a two-staged procedure involving a combined Mustarde's double Z-plasty with transnasal fixation using a 1-0 prolene suture with a flap transfer from the upper lid to the lower lid in the first stage and a lateral canthoplasty with a tarsofrontalis sling and silicone rod in the second stage. This technique is effective to correct epicanthus, telecanthus, ptosis and lateral ectropion in BPES with good cosmetic and functional outcome.

28604951|a|OBJECTIVE: To screen for FOXL2 gene mutations in 6 patients with blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES), and explore their genotype-phenotype correlation. METHODS: Peripheral venous blood samples were collected from the patients for the extraction of genomic DNA. PCR and Sanger sequencing were employed to analyze the coding region and flanking sequences of the FOXL2 gene. Pathogenicity of the identified mutations was verified through literature review and bioinformatic analysis. RESULTS: A heterozygous c.672_701dup30 mutation was found in the probands from the two familial cases, while three heterozygous mutations (two were novel), namely c.462_468del (p.Pro156Argfs*113), c.251T to A (p.Ile84Asn) and c.988_989insG (p.Ala330Glyfs*204) were detected in the three sporadic cases. Literature review and bioinformatic analysis indicated that all these mutations are pathogenic. CONCLUSION: Identification of causative mutations in the BPES patients has provided a basis for genetic counseling and reproductive guidance. The novel mutations have enriched the mutation spectrum of the FOXL2 gene.

28677787|t|Cloning of the promoter region of a human gene, FOXL2, and its regulation by STAT3.
28677787|a|Forkhead box L2 (FOXL2) is a transcription factor, which is involved in blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus in versus syndrome (BPES), premature ovarian failure (POF), as well as almost all stages of ovarian development and function. FOXL2 has various target genes, which are implicated in numerous processes, including sex determination, cell cycle regulation and apoptosis and stress response regulation in mammals. However, studies regarding the upstream regulation of FOXL2 are limited. In the present study, the promoter of FOXL2 was successfully cloned and registered in Gen Bank, and a dual luciferase reporter (DLR) analysis demonstrated that the luciferase activity was significantly induced by the promoter of FOXL2. Subsequently, bioinformatics analysis indicated that FOXL2 may be regulated by STAT3, and this was confirmed by a DLR analysis and western blotting, using STAT3 inhibitors. Further study using real-time cellular analysis indicated that the viability of He La cells was markedly suppressed by STAT3 inhibitors. The present study demonstrated novel findings regarding the upstream regulation of FOXL2 expression and provide a new perspective for future studies in the field.

28849110|t|Identification of a novel FOXL2 mutation in a single family with both types of blepharophimosis--ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome.
28849110|a|Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a rare autosomal dominant disease, which has been divided into two types according to whether it involves premature ovarian failure (POF). Mutations in forkhead box L2 (FOXL2) have been identified in the majority of patients with BPES. The present study aimed to identify the causative mutation in FOXL2 in a Chinese family with both types of BPES. Clinical data and genomic DNA were collected from a single Chinese family with BPES. All the coding exons and adjacent regions of FOXL2 were screened in one affected member to detect the causative mutation using Sanger sequencing. The detected mutation was also screened in available family members and in 100 normal control chromosomes. In total, seven family members were recruited in the present study, including four affected and three unaffected members. The patient (II:5) exhibited typical features of type II BPES, characterized by a narrowed horizontal palpehral aperture, ptosis, epicanthus inversus and telecanthus without POF, whereas the patient's three daughters (III:1, III:2 and III:3) were diagnosed with type I BPES, in which a complex eyelid malformation was accompanied with POF. A novel heterozygous mutation in FOXL2 (c.844_860dup17, p.His291Argfs*71) was found in the four affected members, which was absent in the remaining three unaffected members and in the 100 control chromosomes. This novel duplicate mutation (c.844_860dup17, p.His291Argfs*71) in FOXL2 was identified in a Chinese family with both types of BPES. These findings expand current knowledge of the mutation spectrum of the FOXL2 gene and confirmed the intra-family phenotypic heterogeneity of BPES.

28924383|t|Functional Analysis of a Novel FOXL2 Indel Mutation in Chinese Families with Blepharophimosis-Ptosis-Epicanthus Inversus Syndrome Type I.
28924383|a|Background: Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is an autosomal dominant disease with a low incidence rate. Indel mutations in the forkhead box L2 (FOXL2) gene cause two types of BPES that are distinguished by the presence (type I) or absence (type II) of premature ovarian failure (POF). The purpose of this study was to identify a possible deletion in FOXL2 in Chinese families with BPES and to clarify its relationship with POF. Methods: An autosomal dominant Chinese BPES family with four generations was enrolled in this study. Peripheral venous blood was collected from all affected patients, and genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes. The whole coding sequence and nearby 5' untranslated region (UTR) and 3'UTR of the FOXL2 gene were amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with three sets of overlapping primers, followed by sequencing analyses. The sequencing results were analysed using SeqMan software. Based on the patients' clinical manifestations and analysis of the identified indel mutation, we found that the mutation disturbed interactions between FOXL2 and the StAR gene. Furthermore, through subcellular localisation and functional studies, we observed significant mislocalisation of the mutant protein; the mutant protein was found in the cytoplasm, while the wild-type protein was found in the nucleus. Loss of function was confirmed by transcriptional activity assays, quantitative real-time PCR, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Results: All affected patients presented with clinical features of BPES type I, including small palpebral fissures, ptosis, telecanthus, and epicanthus inversus with POF. A novel FOXL2 heterozygous indel mutation, c.19_95del, a 77-bp deletion that disrupts FOXL2 protein structure, was identified in all affected members of the family. In addition, this indel mutation significantly increased StAR mRNA expression by disrupting the ability of the FOXL2 protein to bind to the StAR promoter and act as a repressor of this gene. Conclusions: A novel FOXL2 indel mutation was identified in Chinese families with BPES. Our results expand the spectrum of known FOXL2 mutations and provide additional insight into the structure-function relationships of the FOXL2 protein. Furthermore, this novel mutation resulted in the dysfunction of FOXL2 as a transcription factor, blocking its ability to bind to the promoter region of the StAR gene, resulting in POF in the affected patient.

29339661|t|A Novel FOXL2 Mutation Implying Blepharophimosis-Ptosis-Epicanthus Inversus Syndrome Type I.
29339661|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a rare autosomal dominant disease caused by FOXL2 gene mutations, and it is clinically characterized by an eyelid malformation associated (type I) or not (type II) with premature ovarian failure (POF). Functional study of novel mutations is especially critical for female patients, as it may allow the prediction of infertility and early planning of an appropriate therapy. METHODS: A clinical and molecular genetic investigation was performed in all members of a Chinese family with BPES. Genomic DNA was extracted, and the FOXL2 coding region was sequenced. Subcellular localization was performed by confocal microscopy. Transactivation studies were performed by real-time PCR, dual luciferase reporter assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. RESULTS: A novel deletion mutation (C.634_641 del, CCCATGC) between the forkhead domain and the polyalanine domain was found, resulting in a frameshift mutation and a truncated protein. Functional studies showed a strong cytoplasmic mislocalization and abnormal transactivation activity, implying a type I kind mutation with a large chance of infertility. CONCLUSION: This study identifies that this mutation indicates the probability of developing into POF and shows the importance and necessity of early recognition of BPES type through mutation testing for female patients. Prompt personalized therapy and follow-up is of great clinical significance for female patients carrying this kind of mutation.

29378385|t|Novel FOXL2 mutations cause blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome with premature ovarian insufficiency.
29378385|a|BACKGROUND: Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a malformation of the eyelids. Forkhead Box L2 (FOXL2) is the only gene known to be associated with BPES. METHODS: We identified two Han Chinese BPES families with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). Sanger sequencing and in vitro functional analysis were performed to identify the genetic cause. RESULTS: Sanger sequencing identified two novel mutations (c.462_468del, c.988_989insG) in FOXL2, one in each family. The in vitro functional analysis confirmed that both novel mutations were associated with impaired transactivation of downstream genes. Specifically, the single-base insertion, c.988_989insG, led to subcellular mislocalization and aggregation of the encoded protein, which validated the hypothesis that the two novel FOXL2 mutations are deleterious and associated with POI in the two BPES families. CONCLUSION: The novel mutations identified in the present study will enhance the present knowledge of the mutation spectrum of FOXL2. The in vitro experiments provide further insights into the molecular mechanism by which the two new variants mediate disease pathogenesis and may contribute to elucidating the genotype-phenotype correlation between the two novel FOXL2 mutations and POI.

29478779|t|Loss of Function of the Nuclear Receptor NR2F2, Encoding COUP-TF2, Causes Testis Development and Cardiac Defects in 46,XX Children.
29478779|a|Emerging evidence from murine studies suggests that mammalian sex determination is the outcome of an imbalance between mutually antagonistic male and female regulatory networks that canalize development down one pathway while actively repressing the other. However, in contrast to testis formation, the gene regulatory pathways governing mammalian ovary development have remained elusive. We performed exome or Sanger sequencing on 79 46,XX SRY-negative individuals with either unexplained virilization or with testicular/ovotesticular disorders/differences of sex development (TDSD/OTDSD). We identified heterozygous frameshift mutations in NR2F2, encoding COUP-TF2, in three children. One carried a c.103_109delGGCGCCC (p.Gly35Argfs*75) mutation, while two others carried a c.97_103delCCGCCCG (p.Pro33Alafs*77) mutation. In two of three children the mutation was de novo. All three children presented with congenital heart disease (CHD), one child with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), and two children with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES). The three children had androgen production, virilization of external genitalia, and biochemical or histological evidence of testicular tissue. We demonstrate a highly significant association between the NR2F2 loss-of-function mutations and this syndromic form of DSD (p = 2.44 x 10-8). We show that COUP-TF2 is highly abundant in a FOXL2-negative stromal cell population of the fetal human ovary. In contrast to the mouse, these data establish COUP-TF2 as a human "pro-ovary" and "anti-testis" sex-determining factor in female gonads. Furthermore, the data presented here provide additional evidence of the emerging importance of nuclear receptors in establishing human ovarian identity and indicate that nuclear receptors may have divergent functions in mouse and human biology.

29480247|t|Ultrasound biomicroscopy image patterns in normal upper eyelid and congenital ptosis in the Indian population.
29480247|a|Purpose: To study the features of upper eyelid in healthy individual and different types of congenital ptosis in the Indian population using ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM). Methods: This was a prospective observational study at a tertiary care center. Eyelid structure of healthy individuals with no eyelid abnormalities (n = 19); simple congenital ptosis (n = 33) cases; Marcus Gunn jaw-winking ptosis (MGJWP, n = 7) cases, and blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES, n = 20) cases were studied on a vertical UBM scan using 50-MHz probe. Lid-thickness, tarsal-thickness, orbicularis oculi and levator-Muller-orbital septum-conjunctival (LMSC) complex were measured in primary gaze. Comparison was made between four groups and results were statistically analyzed using ANOVA test. In normal individuals, LMSC measurements were repeated in down-gaze imaging. Results: Skin with subcutaneous tissue, LMSC complex and pre-aponeurotic fat-pad appeared echodense while orbicularis oculi and tarsus appeared echolucent. In primary gaze, mean thickness (+- standard deviation) of the eyelid, tarsus, orbicularis oculi and LMSC, respectively, were: 1.612 +- 0.205, 0.907 +- 0.098, 0.336 +- 0.083, and 0.785 +- 0.135 mm in normal individual. LMSC showed 46.64% increase in thickness on down-gaze. The mean eyelid thickness and LMSC were thicker in MGJWP and BPES as compared to normal. In different types of congenital ptosis cases, various patterns of UBM imaging were observed. Conclusion: UBM allows noninvasive imaging of eyelid structures with good anatomical correspondence in normal eyelids and study the structural alterations of eyelids in different types of congenital ptosis. UBM can be used to highlight the anatomical difference in normal eyelids that may help modify the surgery for better cosmetic outcomes. Furthermore, it has the potential to be used in preoperative evaluation and operative planning in certain types of acquired ptosis, which needs to be evaluated.

29705893|t|A study of changes in levator muscle in congenital ptosis.
29705893|a|PURPOSE: To study microscopic and ultrastructural changes of levator palpebrae superioris (LPS) muscle in congenital ptosis. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, LPS muscle was studied in 77 eyelids with congenital ptosis; 35-simple congenital ptosis (SCP), 12-Marcus Gunn jaw winking phenomenon (MGJWP), and 30-blepharophimosis epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES). Light microscopy, enzyme histochemistry, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy were performed, and results were analyzed. RESULTS: Muscle fibers were detected in 83.33% of MGJWP, 22.86% of SCP and 16.67% of BPES eyelids. Fibers were detected significantly more in individuals with moderate ptosis, LPS action > 4 mm, present eyelid crease and eyelid fold. Severe endomysial and perimysial fibrosis was seen significantly more in individuals with MGJWP. Fat infiltration and nuclei internalization were seen in all three groups. The absence of degenerating or regenerating fibers and inflammatory cells, normal staining pattern on immunohistochemistry and absence of accumulation of any abnormal substance were found in all three groups. Abnormal mitochondrial staining pattern was seen occasionally in three groups. On electron microscopy, muscle was detected in 1 SCP eyelid and 8 MGJWP eyelids out of which 4 had myofibrillary disruption. All other eyelids where muscle fibers were not detected had only fibrocollagenous tissue. CONCLUSION: Fibrocollagenous tissue predominated in all the cases, and muscle fibers detected correlated inversely with the severity of ptosis. The absence of degenerating, regenerating fibers and inflammatory cells supported the theory of dysgenesis of muscle. However, internalization of nucleus seen in all the subtypes is a feature favoring dystrophy.

29905050|t|[Effectiveness of levator muscle resection combined with Mustarde's double Z-plasty for blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome].
29905050|a|Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of levator muscle resection combined with Mustarde's double Z-plasty to correct blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES). Methods: Between March 2015 and June 2017, one-stage operation of levator muscle resection combined with Mustarde's double Z-plasty were performed on 26 children with bilateral BPES. There were 16 boys and 10 girls with an average age of 7 years (range, 4-14 years). All patients marked the four typical signs of BPES. There were 7 cases accompanied with a low nasal bridge, and 20 cases with amblyopia and strabismus. The length of eye fissure was (19.5+-4.5) mm, the width of eye fissure was (2.5+-1.6) mm, the diameter of inner canthus was (42.1+-6.5) mm, and the muscular strength of levator palpebrae superioris was (5.5+-1.3) mm. Results: All the incisions healed by first intention. Twenty-three patients were followed up 2-12 months, with an average of 10 months. Among which, 2 cases were less corrected, 3 cases were over corrected, 6 cases had poor curvature of the eyelid. No eyelid internal and external pronation or keratitis occurred. Amelioration of blepharoptosis and epicanthus was achieved in the other patients, and the double eyelid fold was naturally smooth. At 7 days after operation, the length of eye fissure was (27.2+-1.9) mm, the width of eye fissure was (12.5+-1.3) mm, and diameter of inner canthus was (29.4+-2.6) mm, which were superior to preoperative values ( t=0.127, P=0.042; t=0.341, P=0.029; t=0.258, P=0.038). There was no angular deformity caused by the width and length regressions of eye fissures. Conclusion: The levator muscle resection combined with Mustarde's double Z-plasty can effectively correct BPES and obtain good effectiveness.

30029625|t|Functional study on new FOXL2 mutations found in Chinese patients with blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus syndrome.
30029625|a|BACKGROUND: Blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a rare inheritable disease that mainly affects eyelid development associated with (type I) or without (type II) ovarian dysfunction, resulting in premature ovarian failure (POF). Mutations in the gene forkhead box L2 (FOXL2) have been shown to be responsible for BPES. The aim of this study was to determine and functionally validate the FOXL2 mutation in a Chinese BPES family. METHODS: Twelve individuals including five BPES patients from a Chinese family were enrolled. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood of enrolled subjects. The coding region of the FOXL2 gene was amplified and mutations were determined by sequencing analyses. Functional analysis was carried out to study changes in expression and transcriptional activity of the mutant FOXL2 protein. RESULTS: A novel mutation in the FOXL2 gene (c.931C > T) was detected in all five BPES patients, which converts a histidine residue into a tyrosine (p.H311Y) in the FOXL2 protein. Functional analysis revealed that this point mutation reduces FOXL2 protein expression, concomitant with decreased transcriptional activity on the steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) gene promotor. CONCLUSIONS: Our results expand the mutational spectrum of the FOXL2 gene and provide additional insights to the research on the molecular pathogenesis of FOXL2 in BPES.

30098246|t|[Analysis of FOXL2 gene mutation and genotype-phenotype correlation in a Chinese pedigree affected with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome].
30098246|a|OBJECTIVE: To detect FOXL2 gene mutation in a Chinese pedigree affected with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) type I, and to explore its genotype-phenotype correlation. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 3 patients and 19 healthy members from the pedigree for the isolation of genomic DNA. All exons and flanking sequences of the FOXL2 gene were amplified by PCR with 7 pairs of overlapping primers and sequenced. RESULTS: DNA sequencing indicated that the BPES phenotype in this pedigree was caused by a hotspot c.843_859dup17 mutation. The same mutation was not found among the healthy members of the pedigree. CONCLUSION: The c.843_859dup17 frameshift mutation probably underlies the BPES type I in this Chinese pedigree, which may manifest as either BEPS type I or type II.

30198434|t|Seven Novel and Three Known Mutations in FOXL2 in 10 Chinese Families with Blepharophimosis Syndrome.
30198434|a|BACKGROUND: Blepharophimosis syndrome (BPES) is characterized by eyelid malformation with occasional premature ovarian failure. Mutations in FOXL2 underlie a fraction of BPES cases. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the genetic basis of BPES in 26 Chinese families that included 78 patients. METHODS: We performed ophthalmological examinations on each family member. We used Sanger sequencing to screen FOXL2 exons and their flanking sequences. We also performed bioinformatics studies, structural modeling and pathogenicity evaluations on all identified variations. Literature was reviewed and genotype-phenotype correlation analysis was performed. RESULTS: The patients had typical manifestations of BPES. Ten mutations were identified in ten of the twenty-six families. Among these, seven were novel mutations. These included the six truncating mutations, p.Glu69*, p.Gly256Glyfs*14, p.Ala14Serfs*135, p.Pro333Profs*200, p.Pro290Leufs*70, and p.Pro157Profs*91, and one missense mutation, p.Tyr59Cys. The mutations were scattered within the gene, and no mutational hotspots were found. Genotype-phenotype correlation analysis showed that frameshift or nonsense mutations were correlated with type I BPES, while in-frame or missense mutations were associated with type II BPES. CONCLUSION: We report the largest BPES cohort in China thus far as well as seven novel mutations in FOXL2. The identification of novel mutations has not only expanded the mutational spectrum of the gene (which is valuable for mutation detection-based screening) but also suggests that most mutations within the Chinese population may not have been characterized yet.

30234390|t|Genetic and Functional Analyses of Two Missense Mutations in the Transcription Factor FOXL2 in Two Chinese Families with Blepharophimosis-Ptosis-Epicanthus Inversus Syndrome.
30234390|a|BACKGROUND: Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a rare autosomal-dominant inherited disease. This study was carried out to investigate the genetic and functional changes within the FOXL2 gene in two Chinese families with BPES. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood of 26 persons from two different Chinese BPES families (13 of which were affected), as well as 200 cataract patients to act as normal controls. FOXL2 gene mutations were detected using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing techniques. Bioinformatic analyses were performed to analyze the structures and functions of the mutant proteins. Wild-type and mutant FOXL2 genes were subcloned into pEGFP-N1 and pCDB vectors and then transfected into COS7 and HEK293T cell lines. We observed protein subcellular localization, and used quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR and western blots to assess regulation of the target OSR2 gene. RESULTS: We detected two novel missense mutations, c.162G>T (p.Lys54Asn) and c.308G>A (p.Arg103His), in the FOXL2 gene; one in each of the study families. Bioinformatic analyses indicated no obvious differences between the wild-type and mutant protein structures. However, they did predict that the two mutations were likely damaging to protein function. We found that the two mutated proteins were both largely distributed within the nucleus and that there was little found in the cytoplasm. The OSR2 mRNA content decreased significantly when the plasmids carrying the c.162G>T and c.308G>A were transfected into COS7 and HEK293 cell lines, when compared to the empty and the wild-type FOXL2 carrier. Western blot analyses indicated, that after transfecting the c.162G>T mutation, the OSR2 protein level was relatively similar to the wild-type, but that the cells transfected with the c.308G>A mutation showed significantly decreased levels of the OSR2 protein. CONCLUSIONS: Our study broadens the BPES gene mutation spectrum and suggests a possible mechanism of action. It also provides reference data for the further studies of BPES.

31048069|t|Clinical characterization and identification of five novel FOXL2 pathogenic variants in a cohort of 12 Mexican subjects with the syndrome of blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus.
31048069|a|Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is an autosomal dominant entity characterized by eyelid malformations and caused by mutations in the forkhead box L2 (FOXL2) gene. Clinical and genetic analyses of large cohorts of BPES patients from different ethnic origins are important for a better characterization of FOXL2 mutational landscape. The purpose of this study is to describe the phenotypic features and the causal FOXL2 variants in a Mexican cohort of BPES patients. A total of 12 individuals with typical facial findings were included. Clinical evaluation included palpebral measurements and levator function assessment. The complete coding sequence of FOXL2 was amplified by PCR and subsequently analyzed by Sanger sequencing. A total of 11 distinct FOXL2 pathogenic variants were identified in our cohort (molecular diagnostic rate of 92%), including 5 novel mutations. Our results broaden the BPES-related mutational spectrum and supports considerable FOXL2 allelic heterogeneity in our population.

31077882|t|Screening of a large cohort of blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome patients reveals a very strong paternal inheritance bias and a wide spectrum of novel FOXL2 mutations.
31077882|a|Blepharophimosis, Ptosis, and Epicanthus inversus Syndrome (BPES) is caused by autosomal dominant mutations in FOXL2. There are two forms of BPES: type I (with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)) and type II (without POI). Data are presented from a large cohort of 177 BPES probands. Diagnostic testing identified a wide range of mutations in 119 mutation-positive patients (including 38 novel mutations). Although FOXL2 mutations are distributed throughout the gene, over 50% were frameshift mutations within a hotspot region of the gene that can be detected using a single primer pair to provide a cost-effective and rapid screening method. There was a significant proportion of de novo cases in this study, although in 7% there may be undetected parental mosaicism. There was an excess of female compared to male probands and a highly significant bias in the parental original of inherited mutations, with 20/21 found to be paternal in origin (95%). This could be because BPES in a female is more likely to come to clinical attention and because there is a generalised and more widespread clinical effect on fertility, in addition to the established association with POI. This study demonstrates the importance of cascade screening and provides new information on inheritance and parental mosaicism in BPES which will aid genetic counselling and accurate risk management.

31191203|t|Blepharophimosis, Ptosis, Epicanthus Inversus Syndrome: New Report with a 197-kb Deletion Upstream of FOXL2 and Review of the Literature.
31191203|a|Blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is due to heterozygous FOXL2 intragenic mutations in about 70% of the patients, whereas total or partial gene deletions account for a minority of cases. Alteration of FOXL2 regulatory elements has been rarely described in patients with BPES. In this study, a prepubertal girl with BPES due to a 197-kb de novo deletion of the regulatory elements upstream of FOXL2 is reported. This girl presented with additional clinical features such as a soft cleft palate and microcephaly; thus, this copy number variant might have other somatic effects. The present deletion encompasses 2 coding genes (MRPS22 and COPB2), whose homozygous mutations have been associated with microcephaly. In our case, the sequences of the non-deleted allele were normal, ruling out a compound genetic defect. Normal levels of new biomarkers of ovarian reserve (anti-mullerian hormone, inhibin B) likely indicate an early diagnosis of type 2 BPES, but an evolutive gonadal damage will be excluded only by long-term follow-up. Additional reports of microdeletions upstream of FOXL2 are needed to better define the underlying genetic mechanism and the related phenotypic spectrum; the ability of the new hormonal markers to predict ovarian function in adolescence and adulthood should be confirmed.

31221094|t|New STAT3-FOXL2 pathway and its function in cancer cells.
31221094|a|BACKGROUND: The forkhead transcription factor (FOXL2) plays a crucial role in blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES), sex determination, ovary growth and development, and cell cycle regulation. Emerging investigations have focused on the downstream targets of FOXL2, while little is known about its upstream regulation. RESULTS: In this study, we show that FOXL2 could be regulated by STAT3 in cancer cells and that STAT3 binds to FOXL2 at the 5'- GCCTGATGTTTGTCTTCCCAGTCTGTGGCAA-3' site using EMSA and ChIP. We further found that knockdown of STAT3 or FOXL2 could significantly induce cancer cell apoptosis, indicating the importance of these two genes in cancer cell growth and apoptosis. Our data also indicated that the increased apoptotic cell rate may be caused by changes in apoptosis-related genes, such as TNF, TRAIL and GnRHR. CONCLUSION: This study presents a new upstream regulator of FOXL2 and demonstrats that this new STAT3-FOXL2 pathway has an important function in HeLaHeLa cell apoptosis, providing new insights regarding the targeting of FOXL2 for cancer prevention and treatment.

31366388|t|Premature ovarian insufficiency as a variable feature of blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome associated with c.223C > T p.(Leu75Phe) FOXL2 mutation: a case report.
31366388|a|BACKGROUND: FOXL2 gene mutations cause blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) and may be associated with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). Two types of BPES were described in the literature. BPES type 2 is a simple association of inherited developmental defects of the eyelid area, while in type 1 female patients additionally suffer from POI. The following case study is the first report of endocrine impairments typical for menopausal transition in young female with NG_012454.1:g.138665342G > A, c.223C > T p.(Leu75Phe), mutation in FOXL2 gene. This mutation has been reported in the literature before, however until now, it was never linked to BPES type 1. CASE PRESENTATION: An 18-year-old nulliparous woman suspected of secondary amenorrhea was referred to our Endocrinology Outpatient Clinic. Blood tests revealed decreased levels of AMH (anti-Mullerian hormone) and increased levels of gonadotropins, suggesting menopausal transition. Her past medical history was remarkable for several ophthalmic defects that has required surgical interventions. BPES syndrome had not been suspected before, although the patient had reported a similar phenotype occurring in her father, sister and half-sister. Venous blood samples were collected from the female proband and from her three family members. Whole-exome sequencing and deep amplicon sequencing were performed. A potential pathogenic variant in the FOXL2 gene was revealed. Namely, the c.223C > T p.(Leu75Phe) missense variant was detected. CONCLUSIONS: The authors found mutations, c.223C > T p.(Leu75Phe) in the FOXL2 gene in a young woman with hormonal disorders suggesting menopausal transition. These results indicate that the possibility of different phenotypes should be considered in patients with a similar genetic mutation.

31823134|t|A novel FOXL2 mutation in two infertile patients with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome.
31823134|a|BACKGROUND: Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a rare, autosomal dominant disease. There are two clinical types of BPES: type I patients have eyelid abnormalities accompanied by infertility in affected females, while type II patients only display eyelid malformations. Previous studies have reported that the forkhead box L2 (FOXL2) gene mutations cause BPES. PURPOSE: To identify plausible FOXL2 mutation in a Chinese family with BPES and infertility METHODS: Mutational screening of FOXL2 was performed in the affected members and 223 controls. Functional characterization of the novel mutation identified was carried out in vitro by luciferase reporter assay and subcellular localization experiment. RESULTS: A novel heterozygous mutation c.188 T > A (p.I63N) in FOXL2 was identified in two BPES patients in this family. The mutation abolished the transcriptional repression of FOXL2 on the promoters of CYP19A1 and CCND2 genes, as shown by luciferase reporter assays. However, no dominant-negative effect was observed for the mutation, and it did not impact FOXL2 protein nuclear localization and distribution. CONCLUSIONS: The mutation c.188 T > A (p.I63N) in FOXL2 might be causative for BPES and infertility in this family and further amplified the spectrum of FOXL2 mutations.

32008456|t|A modified Fox pentagon technique performed using a polytetrafluoroethylene sling in frontalis suspension to treat blepharophimosis syndrome.
32008456|a|The purpose of this study was to evaluate the functional and cosmetic outcomes of a new modified Fox pentagon technique performed using polytetrafluoroethylene in frontalis suspension surgery for blepharophimosis syndrome. This retrospective study enrolled 40 patients diagnosed with blepharophimosis syndrome from March 2016 to October 2018. All patients underwent frontalis suspension using a new modified Fox pentagon technique. The functional and cosmetic outcomes were evaluated. After the operation, the mean palpebral fissure height increased from 2.68 to 6.93 in right eyes and from 2.73 to 6.98 in left eyes. The mean MRD1 increased from 0.53 to 3.76 in right eyes and from 0.50 to 3.78 in left eyes. While preoperative to postoperative differences were statistically significant (p < 0.01), there were no significant differences between right and left eyes either before or after the surgery (p > 0.01). All patients achieved good cosmetic results with an average score of 0.6. We have experimentally created a modified Fox pentagon technique performed using a polytetrafluoroethylene sling in a frontalis suspension to treat BPES; this approach yielded favorable cosmetic and functional outcomes.

32454486|t|Hypopituitarism in Patients with Blepharophimosis and FOXL2 Mutations.
32454486|a|BACKGROUND: FOXL2 is the gene involved in blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES). There have been few single case reports of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) with this syndrome, and Foxl2 is known to be involved in pituitary development in mice. Our aim was to analyze the prevalence of FOXL2 gene alteration in a series of patients with congenital hypopituitarism and eyelid anomalies. METHODS: FOXL2 was analyzed in 10 patients with hypopituitarism (ranging from isolated GHD to complete pituitary hormone deficiency) and eyelid anomalies (typical BPES in 4 patients and milder anomalies in 6 patients). In patients with an FOXL2 mutation, we ruled out other possible molecular explanations by analyzing a panel of 20 genes known to be associated with hypopituitarism, and a candidate gene approach was used for patients without an FOXL2mutation. RESULTS: Three patients had an FOXL2mutation. All 3 had typical BPES. Their pituitary phenotype varied from GHD to complete pituitary hormone deficiency and their pituitary morphology ranged from normal to an interrupted pituitary stalk. No mutations were found in genes previously associated with hypopituitarism. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that some patients with BPES have hypopituitarism with no molecular explanation other than FOXL2 mutation. This points toward an involvement of FOXL2 in human pituitary development.

33185415|t|Genetic conditions impairing female fertility.
33185415|a|Fertility represents a biological and psychological requirement for women. Some genetic diseases represent a rare cause of infertility, being responsible for 10% of cases of premature ovarian insufficiency. Among these, the most frequent and also those most studied by researchers are Turner Syndrome - due to a karyotype abnormality of the X chromosome pair - and the presence of fragile X premutation (FMR1). To exclude these conditions the diagnostic workup for non-iatrogenic premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) involves the performance of a karyotype analysis and the search for the FMR1 gene mutation, as well as the search for the presence of Y-chromosomal material. However, several other mutations and genetic syndromes associated with POI development have recently been highlighted, although they occur rarely, such as the GALT gene mutation in galactosemia or the FOXL2 gene mutation in BPES and many others, and further autosomal genetic testing are indicated if clinical suspicion is present. Mutations of BRCA 1 and 2 genes, make patients at genetically determined high risk of developing early ovarian or breast cancer and of getting POIs for the treatments they must undergo to prevent it (prophylactic bilateral oophorectomy) or treat it (chemotherapy). The management of impaired fertility is not less important than that of other syndromic manifestations for the quality of life of patients. Few data are available regarding the efficiency of cryopreservation of reproductive material (oocytes, embryos or ovarian tissue) in order to preserve fertility in this particular subgroup of patients, but certainly it represents a promising chance and a hope for the future.

33279286|t|[Management of blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus syndrome at a referral center in Tunisia].
33279286|a|INTRODUCTION: Blepharophimosis ptosis epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a rare congenital hereditary abnormality. It includes complex orbital-palpebral malformations, causing aesthetic and functional ramifications. Management of BPES requires two steps : diagnosis and treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective descriptive study of 44 patients (88 eyelids) with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES). In our series, we opted for two-stage surgery in 28 cases : epicanthus-telecanthus surgery followed by ptosis surgery. Simultaneous surgery was performed in 5 cases. RESULTS: The mean age at the first visit was 6 years (6.1+-6.4). The mean age of our patients at the time of the first surgery was 6.6 years. Epicanthus surgery was performed in 35 cases. The two techniques used to correct epicanthus were Y-V plasty in 30 cases (85.7%, n=35) and Y-V+double Z plasty in 5 cases (14.3%, n=35). Correction of the telecanthus was performed at the same time by a medial canthal tendon plication in 31 cases (88.6%, n=35) or transnasal canthopexy in 4 cases (11.4%, n=35). The mean age at the time of ptosis surgery was 7.23 years (+-6.25), ranging from 8 months to 27 years. Ptosis surgery was performed in 41 cases (79 eyelids), of which 3 patients underwent unilateral ptosis surgery due to asymmetrical ptosis. The techniques used were levator resection in 64 eyelids and frontal suspension in 15 eyelids. CONCLUSION: BPES is often clinically diagnosed. The difficulty in management lies in the complex surgery required. There is no established consensus regarding surgical techniques or the timing of the surgeries.

33442089|t|Blepharophimosis Ptosis Epicanthus Inversus Syndrome (BPES) Type 1 in an Indian Family.
33442089|a|Blepharophimosis ptosis epicanthus inversus (BPES) is a relatively rare congenital disorder, which usually presents with classical eye manifestations. In some cases, it is associated with premature ovarian failure (POF). BPES is of two types, type I and type II. Type I is associated with POF along with eyelid malformations, while Type 2 has only eyelid malformations. Here, we report a family of BPES, in whom two sisters presented with secondary amenorrhea. On eye examination, they have blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus and telecanthus. Investigations revealed hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Their father also has similar eye manifestations. Diagnosis of BPES type I was made and both were started on hormone replacement therapy. To make timely diagnosis of BPES, every patient with POF should specifically be checked for eye manifestations.

33796131|t|Functional Studies of Novel FOXL2 Variants in Chinese Families With Blepharophimosis-Ptosis-Epicanthus Inversus Syndrome.
33796131|a|The blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a rare autosomal dominant disease mainly caused by FOXL2 variants. This genetic disorder is usually characterized by eyelid malformation and ovarian dysfunction. However, no reliable genotype/phenotype correlations have been established considering the ovarian phenotype. Here, we detected 15 FOXL2 variants including nine novel ones from 7 families and 8 sporadic cases, which expanded the spectrum of FOXL2 variants and identified a potential clinical cause. Functional studies, with respect to the effect of FOXL2 on the StAR promoter, showed that non-sense variants that lead to protein truncation before the polyalanine tract and missense variants [c.307C > T; p.(Arg103Cys), c.311A > C; p.(His104Pro), c.320G > A; p.(Ser107Asn), and c.335T > A; p.(Phe112Tyr)] within the central portion of the FOXL2 forkhead domain significantly affect its suppressor activity. Such changes may explain the mechanism underlying a more severe phenotype, more likely to result in BPES type I. Furthermore, the missenses variants c.307C > T; p.(Arg103Cys), c.311A > C; p.(His104Pro), and c.320G > A; p.(Ser107Asn) were not able to transactivate OSR2, which is consistent with the eyelid malformation in these patients. The results from our cohort have expanded the spectrum of FOXL2 variants and have provided insights into genotype/phenotype correlations.

33806295|t|The Genetic and Clinical Features of FOXL2-Related Blepharophimosis, Ptosis and Epicanthus Inversus Syndrome.
33806295|a|Blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a craniofacial disorder caused by heterozygous variants of the forkhead box L2 (FOXL2) gene. It shows autosomal dominant inheritance but can also occur sporadically. Depending on the mutation, two phenotypic subtypes have been described, both involving the same craniofacial features: type I, which is associated with premature ovarian failure (POF), and type II, which has no systemic features. The genotype-phenotype correlation is not fully understood, but it has been hypothesised that type I BPES involves more severe loss of function variants spanning the whole gene. Type II BPES has been linked to frameshift mutations that result in elongation of the protein rather than complete loss of function. A mutational hotspot has been identified within the poly-alanine domain, although the exact function of this region is still unknown. However, the BPES subtype cannot be determined genetically, necessitating informed genetic counselling and careful discussion of family planning advice in view of the associated POF particularly as the patient may still be a child. Following puberty, female patients should be referred for ovarian reserve and response assessment. Oculofacial features can be managed with surgical intervention and regular monitoring to prevent amblyopia.

33875939|t|Identification of a novel FOXL2 mutation in a fourth-generation Chinese family with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome.
33875939|a|AIM: To characterize the genetic causes and clinical features in a four-generation Chinese family with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES). METHODS: Thirteen patients with BPES and eight healthy family members were included in this study. All participants received routine ophthalmic examinations. The target next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed to determine the causative mutation for this family. The silico analysis was also applied to predict the pathogenesis of identified mutations. RESULTS: All patients had severe ptosis, normal intelligence, female patients have normal fertility. Genetic assessments revealed a heterozygous insertion variation in FOXL2 gene, c.672_701insGCGGCTGCCGC CGCAGCTGCTG CAGGCGCT (p.Ala234_Gly235linsAAAAAAAAGA), carried by 13 patient but absent in all unaffected members. In silico analysis supported the pathogenic nature of this highly conserved variant. This mutation resulted in the insertion of 10 amino acids into the encoded polyala nine chain, which increased the number of original polyalanine chains from 14 to 24, resulting in an extended protein. CONCLUSION: A novel FOXL2 mutation c.672_701ins GCGGCTGCCGCCGCAGCTGCTGC AGGCGCT (p.Ala234_Gly235linsAAAAAAAAGA) was identified in a large Chinese family with BPES. This study amplified the genotypic spectrum of FOXL2-BPES and better illustrates its genotype-phenotype correlations, which provided a basis for elucidating the pathogenesis of BPES and genetic counseling.

33882191|t|"Blepharophimosis-plus" syndromes: Frequency of systemic genetic disorders that also include blepharophimosis.
33882191|a|BACKGROUND: To determine the frequency of isolated blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) versus systemic genetic disorders in patients presenting with blepharophimosis. METHODS: Retrospective clinical records review. The records of all patients with blepharophimosis seen in the Division of Ophthalmology at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia during a 12-year-period (2009-2020) were reviewed for medical history, clinical examination findings and results of genetic analyses. RESULTS: The 135 patients identified with blepharophimosis included 72 females (53%) and 63 males (47%) whose mean +- standard deviation age at first visit was 3.5 +- 6.4 years (range 0-39.8 years). Sixty-seven of the patients (50%) had undergone genetic testing for FOXL2 gene mutation. Fifty-four (81%) harboured FOXL2 gene mutations and 13 (19%) did not. Altogether, 126 patients (93%) had a final diagnosis of isolated BPES. The remaining nine (7%) had syndromic diagnoses ("blepharophimosis-plus"), including Dubowitz syndrome (n = 2), Ohdo syndrome (n = 1), 22q11.2 duplication (n = 1) and 3q22 deletion (n = 2). Three patients with multiple congenital anomalies remain undiagnosed. CONCLUSIONS: Blepharophimosis is an eyelid feature occurring most commonly in isolation due to FOXL2 gene mutation, but can also be a harbinger of multisystem disease not exclusive to isolated BPES, as observed in 7% of cases in this series. The ophthalmologist is often the first to recognise these unique features, and must consider and rule out non-BPES syndromes before establishing a diagnosed classic BPES. A comprehensive genetic evaluation is, therefore, indicated in all cases.

34338304|t|FOXL2 in adult-type granulosa cell tumour of the ovary: oncogene or tumour suppressor gene?
34338304|a|A recurrent mutation in FOXL2 (c.402C>G; p.C134W) is present in over 95% of adult-type granulosa cell tumours (AGCTs). In contrast, various loss-of-function mutations in FOXL2 lead to the development of blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES). BPES is characterised by an eyelid malformation often accompanied with primary ovarian insufficiency. Two recent studies suggest that FOXL2 C402G is a gain- or change-of-function mutation with altered DNA-binding specificity. Another study proposes that FOXL2 C402G is selectively targeted for degradation, inducing somatic haploinsufficiency, suggesting its role as a tumour suppressor. The latter study relies on data indicative of an FOXL2 allelic imbalance in AGCTs. Here we present RNA-seq data as genetic evidence that no real allelic imbalance is observed at the transcriptomic level in AGCTs. Additionally, there is no loss of protein expression in tumours harbouring the mutated allele. These data and other features of this mutation compared to other oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes argue strongly against FOXL2 being a tumour suppressor in this context. Given the likelihood that FOXL2 C402G is oncogenic, targeting the variant protein or its downstream consequences is the most viable path forward to identifying an effective treatment for this cancer.   2021 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

34553160|t|Planned oocyte cryopreservation in women with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome: a case series.
34553160|a|Objective: To describe the experiences of three women with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) who desired to pursue planned oocyte cryopreservation. Design: Case series. Setting: An academic institution and a private clinic. Patients: Three nulligravid women aged 23, 25, and 34 years who desired to pursue planned oocyte cryopreservation. Two women had BPES diagnosed when they were infants and one had BPES diagnosed after presenting to discuss oocyte cryopreservation. Interventions: All three women underwent ovarian stimulation. One woman underwent three oocyte retrievals. Main Outcomes Measures: Vitrification of metaphase II oocytes. Results: One woman had a total of eight metaphase II oocytes vitrified. In addition, she underwent genetic testing that confirmed type 1 BPES. The other two women, who had BPES diagnosed when they were newborns, each underwent two cycles of ovarian stimulation. Neither of these two women responded to ovarian stimulation and both cycles were cancelled before oocyte retrieval. Conclusions: BPES is a rare condition that can lead to primary ovarian insufficiency. Early identification of this condition is important to allow for timely reproductive counseling so that oocyte cryopreservation can be offered at a young age before oocyte depletion. Careful counseling is critical for these patients, because this case series demonstrated that not all women with BPES will respond to stimulation. Further, outcomes with cryopreserved oocytes have not yet been described in women with BPES.

34555988|t|Association between blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome and lacrimal system anomalies.
34555988|a|Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a congenital eyelid syndrome. Several associations, including the horizontal displacement of the puncta, canalicular stenosis, and ectropion have been so far described. Herein, we report a one-year-old boy presented to the Oculoplastic Clinic of Farabi Eye Hospital with complaint of watery discharge from both eyes since his birth. Based on the general appearance, the diagnosis of BPES was made. Mild tear regurgitation from the inferior punctum was noted. Detailed examination showed bilateral superior punctal agenesis with coloboma of both upper eyelids and lateral displacement of the inferior puncta. Multiple unsuccessful attempts of probing were suggestive of the presence of NLDO. The patient was managed by performing canaliculodacryocystorhinostomy. Osteotomy was performed to pass the canalicular and nasolacrimal obstruction followed by a successful canaliculoplasty. Finally, the lacrimal drainage system was intubated with a mono-Crawford from the inferior punctum into the nasal cavity. On the 1st-month follow-up visit, the complaint of watery discharge was resolved. This is an extremely rare report of nasolacrimal duct and sac anomaly in a patient with blepharophimosis. Thus, we recommend the evaluation of the nasolacrimal drainage system in these patients after the first month of birth.

34711234|t|Confrontment and solution to gonadotropin resistance and low oocyte retrieval in in vitro fertilization for type I BPES: a case series with review of literature.
34711234|a|BACKGROUND: FOXL2 mutations in human cause Blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES). While type II BPES solely features eyelid abnormality, type I BPES involves not only eyelid but also ovary, leading to primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) and female infertility. Current mainstream reproductive option for type I BPES is embryo or oocyte donation. Attempts on assisted reproductive technology (ART) aiming biological parenthood in this population were sparse and mostly unsuccessful. CASE PRESENTATION: Two Chinese type I BPES patients with low anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) and elevated follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) presented with primary infertility in their early 30s. Genetic studies confirmed two heterozygous duplication mutations that were never reported previously in East Asian populations. They received in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment and both exhibited resistance to gonadotropin and difficulty in retrieving oocytes in repeated cycles. Doubled to quadrupled total gonadotropin doses were required to awaken follicular response. Patient 1 delivered a baby girl with the same eyelid phenotype and patient 2 had ongoing live intrauterine pregnancy at the time of manuscript submission. CONCLUSIONS: This is the second reported live birth of biological offspring in type I BPES patients, and first success using IVF techniques. It confirmed that ART is difficult but feasible in type I BPES. It further alerts clinicians and genetic counsellors to type female BPES patients with caution in view of the precious and potentially narrowed reproductive window.

34729743|t|[Phenotype and genetic variant analysis of seven pedigrees affected with blepharophimosis syndrome].
34729743|a|OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical manifestations and gene variants of patients with blepharophimosis, ptosis and epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES). METHODS: Clinical data of 7 pedigrees affected with BPES were collected, and genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples of the probands and their relatives. All exons of the FOXL2 gene were subjected to Sanger sequencing. Those with negative findings were further screened by targeted capture and next generation sequencing (NGS) and microarray analysis. Pathogenicity of candidate variants were predicted by search of PubMed and related databases, and the impact of the variants was interpreted by protein prediction software. Diagnosis was confirmed by clinical phenotype, medical history and mutation analysis. RESULTS: A pathogenic variant was identified in six of the 7 pedigrees, which included four known pathogenic variants and one novel FOXL2 c.299dupA variant. A heterozygous 3q22.3q23 deletion, which encompassed the FOXL2 gene, was identified in another pedigree.As predicted, the c.299dupA frameshift mutation of FOXL2 gene can lead to the premature termination of protein translation, which is pathogenic. CONCLUSION: A novel and 5 known pathogenic variants have been identified in six pedigrees affected with BPES by the combined Sanger sequencing, target capture NGS and microarray analysis. Above findings have enabled genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis for these pedigrees.

34966851|t|ITGB5 mutation discovered in a Chinese family with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome.
34966851|a|Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a rare autosomal-dominant genetic disorder, and mutations in the forkhead box L2 (FOXL2) gene are one of the major genetic causes. As this study shows, there are many patients with BPES who do not have FOXL2 mutations, as the screening results in all family members were negative. Using whole-exome sequence analysis, we discovered another possible mutational cause of BPES in integrin subunit beta 5 (ITGB5). The ITGB5 mutation (c.608T>C, p.Ile203Thr) appears in the base sequence of all BPES+ patients in this family, and it appears to be a three-generation-inherited mutation. It can cause changes in base sequence and protein function, and there may be cosegregation of disease phenotypes. ITGB5 is located on the long arm of chromosome three (3q21.2) and is close to the known pathogenic gene FOXL2 (3q23). This study is the first to report ITGB5 mutations in BPES, and we speculate that it may be directly involved in the pathogenesis of BPES or indirectly through the regulation of FOXL2.

35219116|t|Bilateral cataract in a child with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome: A surgical challenge.
35219116|a|INTRODUCTION: Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by complex orbito-palpebral anomalies. We report a rare case of BPES associated with bilateral congenital cataract. OBSERVATION: This study reports the case of a 6-month-old infant with BPES in whom a bilateral congenital cataract was diagnosed, after the parents noticed leukocoria and signs of poor vision in their child. No other ophthalmologic manifestations commonly associated with this syndrome were found. The infant underwent cataract surgery first, with lens phacoaspiration and posterior capsulotomy coupled with anterior vitrectomy and placement of a 3-piece foldable hydrophobic posterior chamber lens in the capsular bag. The surgery was a real challenge due to the orbito-palpebral anomalies that limited a small surgical space, and the placement of the IOL was a matter of discussion. DISCUSSION: Publications on the association of congenital cataract with BPES are very rare. The link between these two anomalies is difficult to establish since different genes on different chromosomes code for the two diseases. A lateral canthotomy can be considered to overcome the surgical difficulties due to the reduced working space. The surgical management of pediatric cataract varies in the literature. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the difficulty of cataract surgery in children, even more so when associated with BPES, and the challenge of improving vision in these children given the high risk of amblyopia.

35574016|t|Ovarian Reserve and ART Outcomes in Blepharophimosis-Ptosis-Epicanthus Inversus Syndrome Patients With FOXL2 Mutations.
35574016|a|Objective: To characterize the status of ovarian reserve and ART outcomes in BPES women and provide informative reference for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Methods: Twenty-one women with BPES were screened for mutations in the FOXL2 gene and underwent assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment. Indicators for ovarian reserve and ART outcomes were compared between patients with and without FOXL2 mutations. Additionally, ART outcomes were compared among patients with different subtypes of FOXL2 mutations. Results: A total of 13 distinct heterozygous variants in the FOXL2 gene were identified in 80.95% of BPES women, including 4 novel mutations with plausible pathogenicity (c.173_175dup, c.481C>T, c.576del and c.675_714del). Compared to non-mutation group, patients with FOXL2 mutations had elevated levels of FSH (P=0.007), decreased AMH levels (P=0.012) and less AFC (P=0.015). They also had worse ART outcomes with large amount of Gn dosage (P=0.008), fewer oocytes (P=0.001), Day3 good quality embryos (P=0.001) and good quality blastocysts (P=0.037), and a higher cancellation rate (P=0.272). High heterogeneity of ART outcomes existed in BPES patients with different FOXL2 mutation types. Conclusions: BPES patients with FOXL2 mutations had diminished ovarian reserve and adverse ART outcomes. The genotype-reproductive phenotype correlations were highly heterogeneous and cannot be generalized. Genetic counseling for fertility planning and preimplantation or prenatal genetic diagnosis to reduce offspring inheritance are recommended.

35590300|t|Surgical outcome of epicanthus and telecanthus correction by C-U medial canthoplasty with lateral canthoplasty in treatment of Blepharophimosis syndrome.
35590300|a|PURPOSE: To evaluate the surgical outcome of epicanthus and telecanthus correction by C-U medial canthoplasty with lateral canthoplasty in Blepharophimosis Syndrome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective single arm interventional study including 18 eyes of 9 patients with Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome who presented to oculoplastic clinic, ophthalmology department, Qena university hospital in the period of between July 2020 to April 2021. All the patients had BPES with epicanthus and telecanthus. All cases were subjected to by C plasty with medial and lateral canthoplasty for correction of epicanthus and telecanthus correction followed by frontalis suspension surgery to correct the co-existing blepharoptosis. RESULTS: The study included 9 cases of BPES, 6 boys and 3 girls, the mean age was 5.4 +- 1.5 in the study group, all patients had a positive family history for BPES. After surgery, the mean IICD decreased from 38.44 mm preoperatively to 32.8 mm postoperatively, with a mean difference of 6.2 mm (P <  0.001). Likewise, the mean PFL increased from 20.78 mm preoperatively to 26.63 mm postoperatively, with a mean difference of 5.8 mm (P <  0.001). Epicanthus skin fold disappeared in all cases and medical canthus could be seen with well healed difficulty seen scars. CONCLUSION: C-U medial canthoplasty with lateral canthoplasty in Blepharophimosis Syndrome was found to be an effective procedure in the correction of epicanthus and telecanthus.

36051713|t|Blepharophimosis, Ptosis, and Epicanthus Inversus Syndrome: A Simple Remedy for Challenging Cases.
36051713|a|A 14-year-old male presented to the outpatient department of ophthalmology with complaints of visual impairment. The patient was assessed with a detailed history and physical examination. Marked amblyopia was observed on inspection, and his best-corrected vision was 6/36 in both eyes with no further improvement. Both the anterior and posterior segments of the eyes were normal. A diagnosis of blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) was suspected. Surgery was initiated in two stages, with the first stage utilizing Mustarde's double Z-plasty to correct the epicanthus inversus and telecanthus. The second stage was done three months later, involving a tarsofrontalis sling with prolene sutures to correct ptosis. The success of this operation speaks to the efficacy of a two-stage procedure for remedying a syndrome as complex as BPES.

36338666|t|Clinical and genetic studies of 17 Han Chinese pedigrees and 31 sporadic patients with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome.
36338666|a|Purpose: To investigate the molecular pathogenesis of a large group of Han Chinese patients with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES), and to evaluate the correlation between the phenotype and genotype for these patients. Methods: Seventy-six affected individuals, including 45 patients from 17 pedigrees and 31 sporadic patients, were recruited with their family members. All participants underwent complete clinical examinations and were classified as having type I or II based on whether they had premature ovarian failure. The patients' genomic DNA was extracted. A genetic test was performed with direct sequencing of the coding regions of the forkhead transcriptional factor 2 (FOXL2) gene. Variations were analyzed using online databases and programs. Genotype-phenotype correction was investigated. Results: Seventy-six affected and 75 unaffected individuals underwent clinical evaluations and genetic testing. Only one family was diagnosed with type I; the others could not be classified because of a lack of female patients or a definite history of premature ovarian failure. Twenty-seven variations were identified, including 12 novel and 15 previously reported variations. Six variations were detected repeatedly in different nonconsanguineous pedigrees. Four indel variations, located in the alanine/proline-rich region of the FOXL2 gene, presented with a relatively higher frequency. Two rare double variations were detected in two sporadic patients. FOXL2 gene variations were not detected in five sporadic patients. The phenotype varied among different families and patients, although they carried the same variations. Conclusions: We identified 12 novel variations in the FOXL2 gene that would expand the spectrum of the FOXL2 variation database. In addition, we found that the alanine/proline-rich region is a variation hotspot in the FOXL2 gene. The genotype-phenotype correlation is not easy to establish due to clinical and genetic heterogeneity.

10777667|t|Molecular cytogenetic evaluation in a patient with a translocation (3;21) associated with blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES).
10777667|a|Blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus syndrome type I (BPES; OMIM 110100) is an autosomal dominant disorder affecting craniofacial development and ovarian function. We have identified a patient with BPES who carried a de novo reciprocal translocation [46, XX,t(3;21)(q23;q22.1)]. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis at band 3q23 using probes derived from BAC 175G20 (Research Genetics), PACs 108L15 and 169C10 (RPCI1), and cosmids AC174D4, AC68D3, AC44F5, and AC125C5 (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory) was performed. The patient's breakpoint was found to lie within the overlapping region of the BAC and PACs but centromeric to all the cosmids. However, a 10.5-kb BamHI-digested fragment, common to the BAC and PAC clones, was shown to cross the breakpoint. The results have placed our patient's breakpoint proximal to that of the previously reported patient [46,XY,t(3;4)(q23;p15.2)] and within a 10.5-kb interval. This is the second patient in which a breakpoint was refined by molecular cytogenetics. Our findings emphasize the significance of this region for BPES.

10830911|t|Fine mapping of the neurally expressed gene SOX14 to human 3q23, relative to three congenital diseases.
10830911|a|Members of the Sox gene family encode transcription factors that have diverse and important functions during development. We have recently described the cloning of chick and mouse Sox14 and the expression of these genes in a population of ventral interneurons in the embryonic spinal cord. We report here the cloning and sequencing of the human orthologue of Sox14. Human SOX14 shows remarkable sequence conservation compared with orthologues from other vertebrate species and probably mirrors the expression of these genes in the developing brain and spinal cord. Using radiation hybrid mapping and fluorescence in situ hybridisation, we have localised SOX14 close to the sequence tagged site D3S1576 on human chromosome 3q23. Three congenital disorders have been localised to this region: blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES), Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type IIB (CMT2B) and Mobius syndrome type 2 (MBS2). We have found that SOX14 is unlikely to be involved in any of these disorders because of the position of SOX14 proximal to a BPES breakpoint and the lack of SOX14 coding region alterations in BPES, CMT2B and MBS2 patients.

10936053|t|Characterization of the human TBX20 gene, a new member of the T-Box gene family closely related to the Drosophila H15 gene.
10936053|a|T-box transcription factors contain a novel type of DNA-binding domain, the T-box domain, and are encoded by an ancient gene family. Four T-box genes, omb, Trg, org-1, and H15, have been identified in Drosophila, whereas in mammals the T-box gene family has expanded, and 12 human T-box genes have been isolated. We have identified a new human T-box gene, TBX20, and its mouse homologue Tbx20, which are more closely related to the Drosophila H15 gene than to any known vertebrate gene. H15 expression in leg imaginal discs correlates with commitment to a ventral fate, implicating this gene in early patterning events. We find that TBX20 is expressed in the fetal heart, eye, and limb, and during embryogenesis in the mouse, Tbx20 is expressed in the developing heart, eye, ventral neural tube, and limbs, indicating a possible role in regulating development of these tissues. The TBX20 gene maps to chromosome 7p14-p15. An association between TBX20 and loci for retinitis pigmentosa, RP9, and blepharophimosis syndrome, BPES, have been excluded.

10995571|t|Identification of BPESC1, a novel gene disrupted by a balanced chromosomal translocation, t(3;4)(q23;p15.2), in a patient with BPES.
10995571|a|The blepharophimosis syndrome (BPES) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus, and telecanthus. In type I, BPES is associated with female infertility, while in type II, the eyelid defect occurs by itself. The BPES syndrome has been mapped to 3q23. Previously, we constructed a YAC-, PAC-, and cosmid-based physical map surrounding the 3q23 translocation breakpoint of a t(3;4)(q23;p15.2) BPES patient, containing a 110-kb PAC (169-C 10) and a 43-kb cosmid (11-L 10) spanning the breakpoint. In this report, we present the identification of BPESC1 (BPES candidate 1), a novel candidate gene that is disrupted by the translocation on chromosome 3. Cloning of the cDNA has been performed starting from a testis-specific EST, AI032396, found in cosmid 11-L 10. The cDNA sequence of BPESC1 is 3518 bp in size and contains an open reading frame of 351 bp. No significant similarities with known proteins have been found in the sequence databases. BPESC1 contains three exons and spans a genomic fragment of 17.5 kb. Expression of BPESC1 was observed in adult testis tissue. We performed mutation analysis in 28 unrelated familial and sporadic BPES patients, but, apart from the disruption by the translocation, found no other disease-causing mutations. These data make it unlikely that BPESC1 plays a major role in the pathogenesis of BPES.

11175783|a|In type I blepharophimosis/ptosis/epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES), eyelid abnormalities are associated with ovarian failure. Type II BPES shows only the eyelid defects, but both types map to chromosome 3q23. We have positionally cloned a novel, putative winged helix/forkhead transcription factor gene, FOXL2, that is mutated to produce truncated proteins in type I families and larger proteins in type II. Consistent with an involvement in those tissues, FOXL2 is selectively expressed in the mesenchyme of developing mouse eyelids and in adult ovarian follicles; in adult humans, it appears predominantly in the ovary. FOXL2 represents a candidate gene for the polled/intersex syndrome XX sex-reversal goat.

11468277|t|Spectrum of FOXL2 gene mutations in blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus (BPES) families demonstrates a genotype--phenotype correlation.
11468277|a|Mutations in FOXL2, a forkhead transcription factor gene, have recently been shown to cause blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) types I and II, a rare genetic disorder. In BPES type I a complex eyelid malformation is associated with premature ovarian failure (POF), whereas in BPES type II the eyelid defect occurs as an isolated entity. In this study, we describe the identification of novel mutations in the FOXL2 gene in BPES types I and II families, in sporadic BPES patients, and in BPES families where the type could not be established. In 67% of the patients studied, we identified a mutation in the FOXL2 gene. In total, 21 mutations (17 of which are novel) and one microdeletion were identified. Thirteen of these FOXL2 mutations are unique. In this study, we demonstrate that there is a genotype--phenotype correlation for either types of BPES by the finding that mutations predicted to result in a truncated protein either lacking or containing the forkhead domain lead to BPES type I. In contrast, duplications within or downstream of the forkhead domain, and a frameshift downstream of them, all predicted to result in an extended protein, cause BPES type II. In addition, in 30 unrelated patients with isolated POF no causal mutations were identified in FOXL2. Our study provides further evidence that FOXL2 haploinsufficiency may cause BPES types I and II by the effect of a null allele and a hypomorphic allele, respectively. Furthermore, we propose that in a fraction of the BPES patients the genetic defect does not reside within the coding region of the FOXL2 gene and may be caused by a position effect.

11726932|t|A 11.7-kb deletion triggers intersexuality and polledness in goats.
11726932|a|Mammalian sex determination is governed by the presence of the sex determining region Y gene (SRY) on the Y chromosome. Familial cases of SRY-negative XX sex reversal are rare in humans, often hampering the discovery of new sex-determining genes. The mouse model is also insufficient to correctly apprehend the sex-determination cascade, as the human pathway is much more sensitive to gene dosage. Other species might therefore be considered in this respect. In goats, the polled intersex syndrome (PIS) mutation associates polledness and intersexuality. The sex reversal affects exclusively the XX individuals in a recessive manner, whereas the absence of horns is dominant in both sexes. The syndrome is caused by an autosomal gene located at chromosome band 1q43 (ref. 9), shown to be homologous to human chromosome band 3q23 (ref. 10). Through a positional cloning approach, we demonstrate that the mutation underlying PIS is the deletion of a critical 11.7-kb DNA element containing mainly repetitive sequences. This deletion affects the transcription of at least two genes: PISRT1, encoding a 1.5-kb mRNA devoid of open reading frame (ORF), and FOXL2, recently shown to be responsible for blepharophimosis ptosis epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) in humans. These two genes are located 20 and 200 kb telomeric from the deletion, respectively.

11748618|t|Contribution of domestic animals to the identification of new genes involved in sex determination.
11748618|a|Among farm animals, two species present an intersex condition at a relatively high frequency: pig and goat. Both are known to contain XX sex-reversed individuals which are genetically female but with a true hermaphrodite or male phenotype. It has been clearly demonstrated that the SRY gene is not involved in these phenotypes. Consequently, autosomal or X-linked mutations in the sex-determining pathway may explain these sex-reversed phenotypes. A mutation referred to as "polled" has been characterized in goats by the suppression of horn formation and abnormal sexual differentiation. The Polled Intersex Syndrome locus (PIS) was initially located in the distal region of goat chromosome 1. The homologous human region has been precisely identified as an HSA 3q23 DNA segment containing the Blepharophimosis Ptosis Epicanthus locus (BPES), a syndrome combining Premature Ovarian Failure (POF) and an excess of epidermis of the eyelids. In order to isolate genes involved in pig intersexuality, a similar genetic approach was attempted in pigs using genome scanning of resource families. Genetic analyses suggest that pig intersexuality is controlled multigenically. Parallel to this work, gonads of fetal intersex animals have been studied during development by light and electron microscopy. The development of testicular tissue and reduction of germ cell number by apoptosis, which simultaneously occurs as soon as 50 days post coitum, also suggests that several separate genes could be involved in pig intersexuality.

11910558|t|A novel mutation in the FOXL2 gene in a patient with blepharophimosis syndrome: differential role of the polyalanine tract in the development of the ovary and the eyelid.
11910558|a|Blepharophimosis/ptosis/epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by abnormalities of the eyelids. We herein report a 12-year-old girl with BPES who had bilateral blepharophimosis, ptosis, hypertelorism, and downslanting palpebral fissures. Mutation analysis revealed the insertion of a cytosine (dup 1036C) within a wild-type run of six cytosines. A comparison of the phenotypic outcomes of the previously described mutations and the dup 1036C mutation reported herein suggest that the outcome is largely dependent on the involvement of the polyalanine tract (residues 221 to 231). We suggest that the polyalanine tract may have a differential role in eyelid and ovarian development and function. Further work is required to clarify whether ovarian function can be predicted on the basis of genotype.

11960581|t|Two families with blepharophimosis/ptosis/epicanthus inversus syndrome have mutations in the putative forkhead transcription factor FOXL2.
11960581|a|Blepharophimosis/ptosis/epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is an autosomal dominant disorder that is characterized by distinctive eyelid abnormalities. Two clinical subtypes have been described in which type I, but not type II, is associated with premature ovarian failure. Both types of BPES are linked to 3q22-23, and the gene has recently been identified as the putative forkhead transcription factor FOXL2. We report mutation screening of FOXL2 in two families with this condition. The two mutations detected were frameshift mutations resulting from a small insertion or duplication within the gene. Both mutations would result in the production of novel carboxyl terminii, one terminating the predicted protein earlier than the wild type, and the other giving rise to a larger protein product, assuming these proteins or their mRNA were not degraded. Based on the present data, this would suggest that the first family should be type I and the second, type II. Although there is evidence of infertility in the first family, all 3 females in the youngest generation have normal pelvic ultrasound and hormone levels, suggesting that the divide between types I and II may not be as distinct as has been suggested.

12400065|t|Mutations in FOXL2 underlying BPES (types 1 and 2) in Colombian families.
12400065|a|We report the genetic characterization of one family with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) type 1 and two families with BPES type 2 from a historically isolated population in northwest Colombia. Linkage and haplotype analyses indicate that BPES in these families is linked to 3q23. Mutation screening of FOXL2 in the family with BPES type 1 revealed a novel 394C --> T nonsense mutation which deletes the forkhead DNA binding domain. The two families with BPES type 2 both carry an in-frame 30 bp duplication that leads to the elongation of a polyalanine tract. This duplication has been previously reported in Europe, where recurrent mutation has been demonstrated in unrelated familial and sporadic BPES cases. The recurrent nature of this duplication seems to relate to the secondary structure of this DNA region. The genotype-phenotype correlation seen in the Colombian families is consistent with the recent proposal that BPES type 1 is caused by truncating mutations leading to haploinsufficiency, while BPES type 2 is due to mutations generating elongated protein products.

12529855|t|FOXL2 and BPES: mutational hotspots, phenotypic variability, and revision of the genotype-phenotype correlation.
12529855|a|Blepharophimosis syndrome (BPES), an autosomal dominant syndrome in which an eyelid malformation is associated (type I) or not (type II) with premature ovarian failure (POF), has recently been ascribed to mutations in FOXL2, a putative forkhead transcription factor gene. We previously reported 22 FOXL2 mutations and suggested a preliminary genotype-phenotype correlation. Here, we describe 21 new FOXL2 mutations (16 novel ones) through sequencing of open reading frame, 5' untranslated region, putative core promoter, and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. Our study shows the existence of two mutational hotspots: 30% of FOXL2 mutations lead to polyalanine (poly-Ala) expansions, and 13% are a novel out-of-frame duplication. In addition, this is the first study to demonstrate intra- and interfamilial phenotypic variability (both BPES types caused by the same mutation). Furthermore, the present study allows a revision of the current genotype-phenotype correlation, since we found exceptions to it. We assume that for predicted proteins with a truncation before the poly-Ala tract, the risk for development of POF is high. For mutations leading to a truncated or extended protein containing an intact forkhead and poly-Ala tract, no predictions are possible, since some of these mutations lead to both types of BPES, even within the same family. Poly-Ala expansions may lead to BPES type II. For missense mutations, no correlations can be made yet. Microdeletions are associated with mental retardation. We conclude that molecular testing may be carefully used as a predictor for POF risk in a limited number of mutations.

12567411|t|FOXL2-mutations in blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES); challenges for genetic counseling in female patients.
12567411|a|Mutations in the forkhead transcription factor gene 2 (FOXL2) were recently reported to cause blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) types I and II. Evidence was provided that BPES type I (eyelid abnormalities and female infertility) is caused by mutations resulting in a truncated FOXL2 protein. In contrast, mutant FOXL2 proteins, either with inserted aminoacids in the forkhead domain or polyalanine tract, or with novel aminoacids at the carboxyl end, were found in BPES type II, in which fertility is generally normal. We report a 32-year-old female patient with sporadic BPES and a history of menstrual cycle irregularities and periods of secondary amenorrhoea. A heterozygous frameshift mutation (c959-960insG) was found in the FOXL2 gene, resulting in a predicted FOXL2 protein with 212 novel aminoacids in the carboxyl end, suggesting BPES type II despite menstrual irregularities. The clinical presentations of our patient and of three female patients with BPES type II in the report of De Baere et al. [2001: Hum Mol Genet 10:1591-1600.] indicate phenotypic overlap between BPES type I and II. These observations do not support a clear-cut prediction of female fertility based on the FOXL2 molecular defect. As a consequence, FOXL2 mutation testing in female patients of child-bearing age with BPES should be handled with caution, and a two-step genetic counseling approach, including an initial pre-test information session, is proposed.

12810580|t|Etiology of ovarian failure in blepharophimosis ptosis epicanthus inversus syndrome: FOXL2 is a conserved, early-acting gene in vertebrate ovarian development.
12810580|a|Blepharophimosis ptosis epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a human disorder caused by mutations in the forkhead transcription factor gene FOXL2 and is characterized by facial dysmorphology combined in some cases with ovarian failure. To better understand the role of FOXL2 in the etiology of ovarian failure in BPES, we examined its expression in embryonic ovaries of mice, chickens, and red-eared slider turtles, representatives of three phylogenetically distant vertebrate groups that have different mechanisms of sex determination. Expression of Foxl2 was detected in early ovaries of all three species around the time of sex determination and was associated with both somatic and germ cell populations in mice. Expression was sexually dimorphic in all cases. Sequence analysis of turtle and chicken FoxL2 orthologues indicated an unusually high degree of structural conservation during evolution. FoxL2 was found to be autosomal in chickens, and therefore unlikely to represent the dominant ovarian-determining gene that has been postulated to exist as a possible explanation for female heterogamety in birds. Our observations suggest that BPES may result from early abnormalities in regulating the development of the fetal ovary, rather than premature degeneration of the postnatal or adult ovary. Further, our results suggest that FOXL2 is a highly conserved early regulator of vertebrate ovarian development.

12838565|a|Interstitial deletions of the long arm of chromosome 3 are uncommon. Most cases are related to the blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES), which is mapped to 3q23. We report on a case with a de novo chromosomal deletion of 3q23 and 3q25. We review the literature on the reported cases of 3q deletion and find that the condition of our patient is not typical of the BPES. Rather, she shares similarity to a patient with Wisconsin syndrome, first discovered in 1976.

12938087|t|Comparative analysis of the FOXL2 gene and characterization of mutations in BPES patients.
12938087|a|Bleparophimosis ptosis epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a rare disorder characterized by eyelid malformation and in some cases associated with premature ovarian failure. Although the familial form is autosomal dominant, many cases are also sporadic. The mutations causing this disorder were found in a winged/forkhead transcription factor gene named FOXL2. We have sequenced the mouse homolog for the FOXL2 gene and identified the Fugu rubripes (pufferfish) ortholog from the database. By alignment of the three sequences, we found an almost complete conservation of the forkhead domain in the three species. There is 95% and 61% conservation at the protein level between human-mouse and human-pufferfish, respectively. The polyalanine and polyproline tracts within the gene are absent in Fugu rubripes. An overview identifies four breaks in the conservation of the gene within these species. Using a direct sequencing approach, we performed mutation analysis from DNA of nine affected individuals from familial and sporadic cases. The mutations are distributed throughout the coding region of the FOXL2 gene. We identified five novel mutations: g.292delG (E19fsX149); g.530G>A (W98X); g.548A>G (H104R); g.652G>T (E139X); and g.1178_1185del8 (A314fsX530). In addition we also identified two known mutations g.823C>T (Q196X) and g.1092_1108dup17, the latter in individuals from three unrelated pedigrees.

14710475|t|The incidence of strabismus and refractive error in patients with blepharophimosis, ptosis and epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES).
14710475|a|A retrospective review was carried out of 204 patients with blepharophimosis, (blepharo) ptosis and epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES). Of these, 94 (46%) had an autosomal dominant family history of BPES. Forty (20%) had manifest strabismus. Of these, 28 (70%) had esotropia, 10 (25%) had exotropia and 2 (5%) had hypertropia. Twelve (6%) patients had nystagmus. Seventy (34%) patients had a significant refractive error requiring spectacles. Twenty-one (30%) of these patients had anisometropic hypermetropia and 24 (34%) had anisometropic myopia. Forty-three patients had bilateral amblyopia and 40 had unilateral amblyopia, with 26 (65%) of these undergoing occlusion treatment. Of these, 14 had strabismus and refractive error, 7 refractive error only, 2 strabismus only and 3 neither refractive error nor strabismus. We conclude that there is a higher incidence of strabismus and refractive error in patients with BPES than in the normal population.

14736745|t|The murine winged-helix transcription factor Foxl2 is required for granulosa cell differentiation and ovary maintenance.
14736745|a|Human Blepharophimosis/ptosis/epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) type I is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with premature ovarian failure (POF) caused by mutations in FOXL2, a winged-helix/forkhead domain transcription factor. Although it has been shown that FOXL2 is expressed in adult ovaries, its function during folliculogenesis is not known. Here, we show that the murine Foxl2 gene is essential for granulosa cell differentiation and ovary maintenance. In Foxl2(lacZ) homozygous mutant ovaries granulosa cells do not complete the squamous to cuboidal transition leading to the absence of secondary follicles and oocyte atresia. We further demonstrate that activin-betaA and anti-Mullerian inhibiting hormone expression is absent or strongly diminished in Foxl2(lacZ) homozygous mutant ovaries. Unexpectedly, two weeks after birth most if not all oocytes expressed Gdf9 in Foxl2(lacZ) homozygous mutant ovaries, indicating that nearly all primordial follicles have already initiated folliculogenesis at this stage. This activation, in the absence of functional granulosa cells, leads to oocyte atresia and progressive follicular depletion. In addition to providing a molecular mechanism for premature ovarian failure in BPES, these results suggest that granulosa cell function is not only crucial for oocyte growth but also to maintain follicular quiescence in vivo.

14986827|t|Mutational analysis of forkhead transcriptional factor 2 (FOXL2) in Korean patients with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome.
14986827|a|We screened for mutations in the forkhead transcription factor gene, FOXL2, in Korean patients with sporadic or familial blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) by polymerase chain reaction-single-stranded conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and direct sequencing. Five of nine BPES families and three of seven sporadic cases were detected to have FOXL2 mutations. We identified four types of FOXL2 mutations, two of which are novel. A new 14 bp deletion (939-952del14) causing a frameshift from G235W and the extension of the predicted protein to 527 amino acids was detected in a BPES family patient. In addition, a novel 845C > A transversion, resulting in a nonsense mutation (S203X), was found in a sporadic case of BPES. The previously reported in-frame 30 bp duplication (909-938dup30) was the most common mutation and was found in eight patients of four BPES families and one sporadic case. A known 17 bp duplication (1080-1096dup17) was observed in a sporadic BPES case. We were unable to find a causal mutation in four BPES families and four sporadic cases. These results suggest that in a fraction of BPES patients, the genetic defect might be associated with a mutation in the non-coding region of the FOXL2 gene or in other genes.

15056605|t|Foxl2 disruption causes mouse ovarian failure by pervasive blockage of follicle development.
15056605|a|FOXL2 mutations cause gonadal dysgenesis or premature ovarian failure (POF) in women, as well as eyelid/forehead dysmorphology in both sexes (the 'blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome', BPES). Here we report that mice lacking Foxl2 recapitulate relevant features of human BPES: males and females are small and show distinctive craniofacial morphology with upper eyelids absent. Furthermore, in mice as in humans, sterility is confined to females. Features of Foxl2 null animals point toward a new mechanism of POF, with all major somatic cell lineages failing to develop around growing oocytes from the time of primordial follicle formation. Foxl2 disruption thus provides a model for histogenesis and reproductive competence of the ovary.

15081106|t|FOXL2 inactivation by a translocation 171 kb away: analysis of 500 kb of chromosome 3 for candidate long-range regulatory sequences.
15081106|a|A translocation breakpoint 171 kb 5' of the transcription start of FOXL2 causes blepharophimosis/ptosis/epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) and associated premature ovarian failure. The breakpoint falls within another gene, MRPS22, that has been sequenced in 500 kb of continuous DNA. MRPS22 encodes 20 exons and a number of alternative transcripts. Three CpG islands (>91% identical) are followed by noncoding exons 4-12 and coding exons 13-20. The 3'UTR extends into the 3'UTR of COPB2. Based on the sequence, three reported translocations that cause BPES all fall within intron 6 of MRPS22. Comparisons reveal conserved segments in introns 6, 11, and 12 of human and mouse. Notably intron 11 sequence is also deleted in goat PIS syndrome (which combines craniofacial defects, female infertility, and XX sex reversal). The conserved sequences are candidates for models in which they are distant enhancers or otherwise affect higher order chromatin structure to impose long-range cis regulation of FOXL2 expression.

15176598|t|[A case of severe mental retardation with blepharophimosis, ptosis, microphthalmia, microcephalus, hypogonadism and short stature--the difference from Ohdo blepharophimosis syndrome].
15176598|a|We report a case of 13-year-old girl with short stature, microcephalus, blepharophimosis, ptosis, bilateral microphthalmia (more prominent in the right), hypogonadism, other minor anomalies, and severe mental retardation. Her mother had two spontaneous abortions. She was born as the second baby of dizygotic twins. The first baby died of diaphragm hernia and heart failure. Her body height, body weight and head circumference were below -3 SD. She did not have epicanthus inversus, hypoplastic teeth, heart anomalies, seizures, muscle weakness, and hearing loss. She was able to handle her wheelchair, but could neither understand nor speak meaningful words. When she looked at something in front of herself, she turned her face up and lifted the left eyelid with her own fingers. She had no somatic change of puberty. Laboratory and radiological examinations demonstrated a normal karyotype, normal bone age, findings of Chilaiditi syndrome, and absence of brain malformation on cranial CT. The serum levels of LH and FSH were high for age and those of estradiol and progesterone were low, suggesting immaturity of ovarian function. These findings suggested the ovarian functions might not get maturations. Hypogonadism has previously been reported in female cases of the blepharophimosis, ptosis and epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) type I, but not in those with the Ohdo blepharophimosis syndrome (OBS). Our case's condition differs from BPES because of the presence of mental retardation and the absence of epicanthus inversus. We also discuss the distinction from OBS, a disease entity of unknown etiology presenting with a variety of complications.

15181179|t|Mutations in the coding region of the FOXL2 gene are not a major cause of idiopathic premature ovarian failure.
15181179|a|Premature ovarian failure (POF) is a heterogeneous disorder whose aetiology is still unknown. Recently, the autosomal FOXL2 gene, highly expressed in the adult ovary, has been correlated with the disorder. FOXL2 mutations, causing a truncation of the FOXL2 protein in the forkhead domain or in the poly-Ala tract lead to blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus-inversus syndrome associated with POF (BPES I). Interestingly, in two out of 70 idiopathic POF patients, a 30 bp deletion (898-927del) and a missense mutation (1009T-->A) were identified. To further evaluate the correlation between POF and FOXL2 mutations, 120 phenotypically normal women affected by POF were analysed by direct sequencing of the FOXL2 coding region. The analysis did not reveal any mutation in the 240 analysed chromosomes, indicating that mutations in the FOXL2 coding region are rarely associated with non-syndromic POF.

15257268|t|Genetic analysis of a five generation Indian family with BPES: a novel missense mutation (p.Y215C).
15257268|a|PURPOSE: Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a rare eye genetic disorder caused by mutations in the FOXL2 gene located at chromosome 3q23. The purpose of the present study was to carry out genetic analysis of BPES in a five-generation Indian family. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were obtained from individuals for genomic DNA isolation. To determine the linkage of this family to the FOXL2 locus, haplotype analysis was carried out using microsatellite markers from the BPES candidate region. Five overlapping sets of primers were used to amplify the entire coding region of the FOXL2 gene for mutation detection. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization (ASOH) analysis was carried out to determine segregation of the mutation in the family and to also determine if the mutation was present in 100 ethnically matched normal control chromosomes. RESULTS: Pedigree analysis suggested that BPES segregated in this family as an autosomal dominant trait. Cytogenetic analysis in one patient did not reveal any rearrangement. Haplotype analysis suggested that this family was linked to the FOXL2 locus on chromosome 3q23. DNA sequence analysis showed that the BPES phenotype in this family was caused by a novel missense mutation, c.881A->G (p.Y215C). CONCLUSIONS: This study reports for the first time a novel missense mutation in a five-generation Indian family with BPES. A review of the literature showed that the total number of mutations in the FOXL2 gene described to date is 42.

15300845|t|The human FOXL2 mutation database.
15300845|a|Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES; MIM# 110100) is an autosomal dominant genetic condition in which an eyelid malformation is associated (type I) or not associated (type II) with premature ovarian failure (POF). In 2001, mutations in the FOXL2 gene, encoding a forkhead transcription factor, were shown to cause both BPES type I and II. Since then, a number of reports have appeared that describe intragenic FOXL2 mutations in BPES patients. In addition, a few FOXL2 variants have been reported in isolated POF patients and XX males. Previously, our group has described a large number of FOXL2 mutations, thereby demonstrating the existence of two mutational hotspots in FOXL2, intra- and interfamilial phenotypic variability in BPES families, and genotype-phenotype correlations for a number of mutations in BPES patients. Here we describe a locus-specific Human FOXL2 Mutation Database (http://medgen.ugent.be/foxl2/), created using the MuStaR software. Our database contains general information about the FOXL2 gene, as well as details about 135 intragenic mutations and variants of FOXL2, obtained from published papers, abstracts of meetings, and from unpublished data produced by our group. Not included in the current version of the database are variants residing outside the coding region of FOXL2 and molecular cytogenetic rearrangements of the FOXL2 locus. The Human FOXL2 Mutation Database was created to provide a unique publicly available online resource of information about human FOXL2 mutations/variants associated with BPES and POF. It allows remote users to submit new mutations to the database and to query the database using a web form. It will facilitate evaluation of the pathogenicity of a particular mutation, as it contains data about disease-causing mutations and polymorphisms in BPES and isolated POF patients, and a link to the known FOXL2 orthologs. Moreover, it will allow us to establish more accurate genotype-phenotype correlations, since clinical information is contained in the database.

15450400|t|A novel insertion mutation in the FOXL2 gene is detected in a big Chinese family with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus.
15450400|a|Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES), an autosomal dominant syndrome in which an eyelid malformation is associated (type I) or not (type II) with premature ovarian failure (POF), has recently been ascribed to mutations in the forkhead transcription factor 2 (FOXL2) gene. In this work, we reveal a novel insertion mutation in the 3'UTR of the FOXL2 gene in a big Chinese family which is to our knowledge the first BPES (type II) family reported in China. It is the first time that a 3'UTR mutation in the FOXL2 gene has ever been found to demonstrate a close correlation between genotype and BPES. Our result gains a greater insight into the function of 3'UTR in the FOXL2 gene.

15459170|t|A novel 30 bp deletion in the FOXL2 gene in a phenotypically normal woman with primary amenorrhoea: case report.
15459170|a|In a Slovene patient with primary amenorrhoea without an association with blepharophimosis/ptosis/epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES), a novel 30 bp deletion was identified in the FOXL2 gene. We report the clinical features of this woman who has spontaneously conceived and delivered two live healthy babies. The novel deletion was predicted to remove 10 out of 14 alanines (A221_A230del), from the polyalanine tract downstream of the winged helix/forkhead domain of the FOXL2 protein. The patient's parents and sister were shown not to carry this deletion. Despite seeing an anovulatory secretory pattern of FSH, follicles developed spontaneously. Persistent and consistent monitoring have practical implications for genetic and fertility counselling in the era when women with premature ovarian failure usually seek ovum donation. The role of FOXL2 in the development of infertility is still unclear, but several lines of evidence suggest that it plays a central role in follicle development.

15517586|t|Isolation of chicken homolog of the FOXL2 gene and comparison of its expression patterns with those of aromatase during ovarian development.
15517586|a|Mutations in the forkhead transcription factor gene FOXL2 are involved in ovarian failure, which occurs in human BPES syndrome. This syndrome presents a sexually dimorphic expression, specific to the ovary in several vertebrates. We cloned the open reading frame of chicken FOXL2 (cFoxL2) and studied cFoxL2 expression in developing gonads and during adulthood to examine the role of FOXL2 in ovarian differentiation and function in birds. The spatial and temporal dynamics of cFoxL2 and aromatase expression were analyzed in parallel by using real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry in attempt to investigate the possible role of cFoxL2 in the regulation of aromatase. The expression patterns of cFoxL2 and aromatase transcripts were highly correlated during the sex-differentiation period (4.7-12.7 days of incubation). Aromatase and cFoxL2 proteins were colocalized in the medullar part of female gonads on embryonic day 14. Fourteen days after hatching, cFoxL2 protein was mainly detected in granulosa cells of developing follicles. In adult ovary follicular envelopes, apart from granulosa cells, cFoxL2 transcript and protein were detected at lower levels in theca cells where aromatase was present. A high level of cFoxL2 transcription was also observed in maturing and ovulated oocytes. Our results confirm that FoxL2 is an early regulator of ovarian development in birds and may be involved in aromatase transcription regulation.

15962237|t|Deletions involving long-range conserved nongenic sequences upstream and downstream of FOXL2 as a novel disease-causing mechanism in blepharophimosis syndrome.
15962237|a|The expression of a gene requires not only a normal coding sequence but also intact regulatory regions, which can be located at large distances from the target genes, as demonstrated for an increasing number of developmental genes. In previous mutation studies of the role of FOXL2 in blepharophimosis syndrome (BPES), we identified intragenic mutations in 70% of our patients. Three translocation breakpoints upstream of FOXL2 in patients with BPES suggested a position effect. Here, we identified novel microdeletions outside of FOXL2 in cases of sporadic and familial BPES. Specifically, four rearrangements, with an overlap of 126 kb, are located 230 kb upstream of FOXL2, telomeric to the reported translocation breakpoints. Moreover, the shortest region of deletion overlap (SRO) contains several conserved nongenic sequences (CNGs) harboring putative transcription-factor binding sites and representing potential long-range cis-regulatory elements. Interestingly, the human region orthologous to the 12-kb sequence deleted in the polled intersex syndrome in goat, which is an animal model for BPES, is contained in this SRO, providing evidence of human-goat conservation of FOXL2 expression and of the mutational mechanism. Surprisingly, in a fifth family with BPES, one rearrangement was found downstream of FOXL2. In addition, we report nine novel rearrangements encompassing FOXL2 that range from partial gene deletions to submicroscopic deletions. Overall, genomic rearrangements encompassing or outside of FOXL2 account for 16% of all molecular defects found in our families with BPES. In summary, this is the first report of extragenic deletions in BPES, providing further evidence of potential long-range cis-regulatory elements regulating FOXL2 expression. It contributes to the enlarging group of developmental diseases caused by defective distant regulation of gene expression. Finally, we demonstrate that CNGs are candidate regions for genomic rearrangements in developmental genes.

16015581|t|Interstitial deletion in 3q in a patient with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) and microcephaly, mild mental retardation and growth delay: clinical report and review of the literature.
16015581|a|We present a boy with blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus, microcephaly, mild mental retardation, and growth delay. Chromosomal analysis revealed a male karyotype with an interstitial deletion in the long arm of chromosome 3. DNA-analysis showed that the deletion is of maternal origin and encompasses the region between markers D3S1535 and D3S1593. The deletion contains not only the FOXL2 gene, but also the gene encoding ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR). Mutations in FOXL2 have been shown to cause blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES). ATR has been identified as a candidate gene for Seckel syndrome, an autosomal recessive syndrome that comprises growth retardation, microcephaly, and mental retardation. We hypothesize that our patient has a contiguous gene syndrome and that the non-BPES-associated abnormalities (microcephaly, mild mental retardation, and growth delay) are the result of the deletion of the maternal ATR gene. However, it has not yet been excluded that haploinsufficiency of some other gene in this region plays a role.

16086270|t|A novel mutation in the FOXL2 gene in a Chinese family with blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome.
16086270|a|OBJECTIVE: To screen mutations in the forkhead transcriptional factor 2 gene (FOXL2) in six Chinese families with blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome(BPES). METHODS: PCR amplification and direct sequencing of the FOXL2 coding region in genomic DNA were performed in affected patients and 80 healthy controls. BLAST analysis of the sequence was made on Internet. RESULTS: A novel 951-953(delC) was found in the two affected patients of a Chinese family with BPES. No mutations were found in the healthy controls. The 951-953(delC) may cause a frameshift mutation after codon 238 that exists downstream of the forkhead domain, resulting in the production of truncated proteins. CONCLUSION: These findings indicated that the 951-953(delC) deletion mutation in the two patients resulted in truncated proteins and hence led to their BPES. To the authors' knowledge, the 951-953(delC) in FOXL2 has not been previously reported.

16131596|t|A new heterozygous mutation of the FOXL2 gene is associated with a large ovarian cyst and ovarian dysfunction in an adolescent girl with blepharophimosis/ptosis/epicanthus inversus syndrome.
16131596|a|Blepharophimosis/ptosis/epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES), an autosomal dominant syndrome in which eyelid malformation is associated with (type I BPES) or without premature ovarian failure (type II BPES). Mutations of a putative winged helix/forkhead transcription factor FOXL2 account for both types of BPES. We report on a 16-year-old adolescent girl with blepharophimosis and ptosis. Subsequently she developed oligomenorrhea, secondary amenorrhea for 6 months, and an extremely large cyst of one ovary. The cyst contained 8 l of cyst fluid and histopathology displayed a large corpus luteum cyst. Following laparotomy, gonadotropin levels were elevated (LH 17.2 U/l, FSH 29.4 U/l) and estradiol levels decreased (67 pmol/l). Because of clinical aspects of BPES and abnormal ovarian function we suspected a mutation of her FOXL2 gene and found a new in-frame mutation (904_939dup36) on one allele, leading to a 12 alanine expansion within the polyalanine domain. We conclude that the FOXL2 mutation 904_939dup36 may account not only for blepharophimosis and ptosis but also for ovarian dysfunction and growth of the large corpus luteum cyst. In contrast to known FOXL2 mutations with polyalanine expansions and association with BPES type II, clinical aspects of our girl may indicate some degree of ovarian dysfunction that might finally lead to BPES type I with premature ovarian failure.

16137905|t|Pisrt1, a gene implicated in XX sex reversal, is expressed in gonads of both sexes during mouse development.
16137905|a|XX sex reversal syndromes not involving Sry provide an opportunity to identify and study genes important for sexual development. The polled intersex syndrome (PIS) in goats, which shares some features with blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) in humans, exemplifies such syndromes. BPES is caused by defects in the forkhead transcription factor gene FOXL2, while PIS is caused by a large deletion of goat chromosome 1q43 that affects transcription of the genes Pisrt1 and Foxl2. Pisrt1 is a non-translated gene that has a sexually dimorphic expression pattern in goats. Here, we describe the structure and expression of the mouse Pisrt1 locus, to investigate its likely role in ovarian development more broadly in mammals. This gene showed some sequence similarity, and was found in a similar genomic context, to its goat and human orthologues. Expression analyses indicated that Pisrt1 is transcribed, and its mRNA polyadenylated and exported to the cytoplasm, but no significant open reading frames were found in a 1.5kb mouse genomic region corresponding to goat Pisrt1. Pisrt1 transcripts were expressed very broadly among tissues of the developing mouse embryo, and at similar levels in male and female gonads at each stage examined, as determined by in situ hybridisation and RT-PCR. This profile of expression suggests that Pisrt1 is unlikely to contribute to sex-specific events during gonadal development in mice and that divergent pathways of ovarian development operate among different mammalian species.

16208278|t|Premature ovarian failure and forkhead transcription factor FOXL2: blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome and ovarian dysfunction.
16208278|a|Recently the molecular basis of the blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus-syndrome (BPES), an autosomal dominant developmental disorder of the eyelids and ovary, was elucidated. This syndromic form of premature ovarian failure (POF) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the forkhead transcription factor FOXL2. In this manuscript we review the clinical features of BPES, its molecular basis, the structural and functional characteristics of the FOXL2 gene and protein, and known animal models.

16283882|t|Blepharophimosis and bilateral Duane syndrome associated with a FOXL2 mutation.
16283882|a|This case describes the novel coexistence of sporadic blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) and bilateral type I Duane syndrome in a female infant, with a FOXL2 mutation. Mutational analysis of FOXL2 demonstrated a 30-nucleotide duplication (c.672(-)701dup30) within the polyalanine tract of FOXL2. The association of BPES and Duane syndrome represents a novel phenotype which may suggest a greater pleiotropic effect of FOXL2 in development. During the period of the 4-8th week of embryonic development, the cranial nerves, their nuclei and the corresponding innervation to the extraocular muscles develop, the extraocular muscles undergo development and differentiation. This coincides with the period of time that FOXL2 is expressed strongly in the developing eyelids and the surrounding tissues. Forkhead genes are transcription factors and likely to be involved in signal transduction pathways. This case expands the spectrum of FOXL2 mutations associated with BPES.

16394030|t|Mutation analysis of the FOXL2 gene in Chinese patients with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome.
16394030|a|Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by blepharophimosis, ptosis and epicanthus inversus. Based on the presence and absence of premature ovarian failure, two clinical types have been distinguished. Both types of BPES have been mapped to chromosome 3q23 and are mostly due to mutations of a forkhead transcription factor FOXL2 gene which locates at this region. We screened for FOXL2 mutations in Chinese patients with BPES. A novel mutation (g.901-930dup30) which could result in an expansion of the polyalanine tract was found in two BPES type II families and one sporadic case. In addition, a new g.952delC mutation was identified in two patients from a BPES family of undetermined type. The previously reported g.892C>T (p.Q219X) was also found in 12 patients from a large BPES family of type I. No mutations were detected in three other BPES families and three sporadic cases. So we speculate that in a fraction of the BPES patients the genetic defect may represent a change in gene dosage or a rearrangement outside the transcription unit of FOXL2.

16481406|t|An investigation into FOXE1 polyalanine tract length in premature ovarian failure.
16481406|a|Premature ovarian failure (POF) is a common condition affecting 1% of women worldwide. There is strong evidence for genetic involvement in POF as many cases are familial, and mutations in several genes have been associated with POF. We investigated variation in FOXE1 polyalanine tract length, following the observation that polyalanine tract deletions are seen in the closely related FOXL2 in patients with POF. In addition, polyalanine tract expansions in FOXL2 are often seen in patients with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES), a rare eyelid disorder often associated with POF. The FOXE1 polyalanine tract shows marked variation in its length between POF patients and normal controls, existing as an allele of 12, 14, 16, 17 or 19 alanine residues. We found evidence to suggest that variation in FOXE1 polyalanine tract length predisposes to POF.

16647286|t|Foxl2 function in ovarian development.
16647286|a|Foxl2 is a forkhead transcription factor essential for proper reproductive function in females. Human patients carrying mutations in the FOXL2 gene display blepharophimosis/ptosis/epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES), an autosomal dominant disease associated with eyelid defects and premature ovarian failure in females. Recently, animal models for BPES have been developed that in combination with a catalogue of human FOXL2 mutations provide further insight into its molecular function. Mice homozygous mutant for Foxl2 display craniofacial malformations and female infertility. The analysis of the murine phenotype has revealed that Foxl2 is required for granulosa cell function. These ovarian somatic cells surround and nourish the oocyte and play an important role in follicle formation and activation. Mutations upstream of FOXL2 in humans, not affecting the coding sequence itself, have also been shown to cause BPES, which points to the existence of a distant regulatory element necessary for proper gene expression. The same regulatory sequences may be deleted in the goat polled intersex syndrome (PIS), in which FoxL2 expression is severely reduced. Sequence comparison of FoxL2 from several vertebrate species has shown that it is a highly conserved gene involved in ovary development. Thus, the detailed understanding of Foxl2 function and regulation and the identification of its transcriptional targets may open new avenues for the treatment of female infertility in the future.

16762234|t|[Mutation analysis of FOXL2 in Chinese patients with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome].
16762234|a|OBJECTIVE: To identify the genetic mutation in two Chinese families and 6 sporadic patients with belpharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES). METHODS: Polymorphisms of 5 satellite markers on 3q were analyzed and linkage analysis was performed using linkage software (MLINK) in all cases of two families. FOXL2 gene fragments were amplified by PCR and mutation was determined by sequencing DNA fragments in all patients. RESULTS: The BPES locus in the pedigrees was mapped to 3q23, a 9.88 cM interval between markers D3S3696 and D3S1744. The maximum lod scores were 2.11 (theta = 0.00) at D3S1549 and D3S3586 and 1.51 (theta = 0.00) at D3S1764. By direct sequencing FOXL2 gene, two sporadic cases had a 30-bp in frame duplication 909 - 938 dup 30 and one sporadic case showed a nucleotide insertion 1041 - 1042 ins C. However, it was unable to find any causal mutation of FOXL2 in two families with BPES. CONCLUSIONS: The gene responsible for BPES in two Chinese families was linked to D3S1549, D3S3586 and D3S1764. This is the first reported mutations of FOXL2 (909 - 938 dup 30 and 1041 - 1042 ins C) in Chinese sporadic cases. One of the mutations, in-frame 30-bp duplication (909 - 938 dup 30), is one of the most common mutation hotspots in the coding region of FOXL2. In BPES families without FOXL2 mutation, it cannot be excluded that the disorder is caused by a position effect in the surrounding region of FOXL2 gene or by other genes located at 3q23.

17050282|t|Familial blepharophimosis-like syndrome with esotropia, uveal coloboma, and short stature.
17050282|a|BACKGROUND: Interstitial deletion of Hsa 3q involves FOXL2, the gene responsible for blepharophimosis-ptosis-telecanthus-epicanthus inversus (BPES). Thought to be due to a contiguous gene syndrome, the recognizable phenotype of 3q interstitial deletion includes BPES facies and has not been associated with other loci. OBJECTIVE: To describe a familial syndrome that resembles the interstitial deletion of 3q clinically, but does not map to the FOXL2 region. METHODS: Clinical evaluation of family members and linkage analysis. RESULTS: Three affected siblings with a phenotype resembling that seen in 3q interstitial deletion were studied in addition to their clinically unaffected parents. Linkage analysis excluded FOXL2 as underlying the distinct phenotype, observed with > 99% confidence. CONCLUSIONS: The relevant locus in the current family, although remote from FOXL2, is likely important to the FOXL2 functional pathway. The phenotype observed in 3q interstitial deletion may be due to severe disruption of FOXL2 rather than to a contiguous gene syndrome.

17089161|t|A novel polyalanine expansion in FOXL2: the first evidence for a recessive form of the blepharophimosis syndrome (BPES) associated with ovarian dysfunction.
17089161|a|The blepharophimosis syndrome (BPES) is an autosomal dominant developmental disorder in which craniofacial/eyelid malformations are associated (type I) or not (type II) with premature ovarian failure (POF). Mutations in the FOXL2 gene, encoding a forkhead transcription factor, are responsible for both types of BPES. Heterozygous polyalanine expansions of +10 residues (FOXL2-Ala24) account for 30% of FOXL2 mutations and are fully penetrant for the eyelid phenotype. Here we describe the first homozygous FOXL2 mutation leading to a polyalanine expansion of +5 residues (FOXL2-Ala19). This novel mutation segregates in an Indian family where heterozygous mutation carriers are unaffected whereas homozygous individuals have the typical BPES phenotype, with proven POF in one female. Expression of the FOXL2-Ala19 protein in COS-7 cells revealed a significantly higher cytoplasmic retention compared to the wild-type protein. This is the first study providing genetic evidence for a recessive inheritance of BPES associated with ovarian dysfunction.

17214723|t|Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES).
17214723|a|Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a rare inherited condition that includes characteristic eyelid malformations and sometimes reduced fertility in females. Genetic studies have implicated mutations in the forkhead transcription factor FOXL2 as responsible for BPES. We report a female and her father with BPES type I, who presented the 1092-1108dup17 mutation in the FOXL2 gene. Molecular studies and the typical clinical features of BPES should allow the dermatologist to reach an early diagnosis and permit the treatment of eyelid alterations and the investigation of infertility.

17277738|t|FOXL2 mutations in Chinese patients with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome.
17277738|a|PURPOSE: Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is an autosomal dominant disorder where eyelid malformation associated with (type I) or without (type II) premature ovarian failure (POF). It is ascribed to mutations in the forkhead transcriptional factor2 (FOXL2) gene. The purpose of this study is to identify mutations in FOXL2 of Chinese patients with BPES. METHODS: Genomic DNA was prepared from leucocytes of peripheral venous blood. The coding regions and nearby intron sequences of FOXL2 were analyzed by cycle and cloning sequencing. RESULTS: Four mutations in FOXL2 were identified in six families, including c.241T>C, c.650C>G, c.804dupC, and c.672_701dup. Of the four, the c.241T>C and c.650C>G were novel and would result in missense changes of the encoded proteins, i.e., p.Tyr81His and p.Ser217Cys, respectively. The c.672_701dup (p.Ala224_Ala234dup) was detected in three families, indicating a mutation hotspot. The c.804dupC (p.Gly269ArgfsX265) mutation was found in one family. CONCLUSIONS: Our results expand the spectrum of FOXL2 mutations and confirm the mutation hotspot in FOXL2.

17430514|t|Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome: objective analysis of surgical outcome in patients from a single unit.
17430514|a|BACKGROUND: The aim was to objectively assess surgical outcome in blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES). METHOD: Retrospective review of 14 consecutive patients with BPES. Mustarde double z plasty (at about age 4) and autogenous fascia lata Crawford brow suspension (9-12 months later) were used in all. One consultant performed all operations. Patient photographs were scanned and magnified for analysis. Preoperative and postoperative intercanthal distance, vertical palpebral aperture and cosmetic outcome were measured. Values were converted into ratios. RESULTS: Bilateral (mildly asymmetrical) ptosis and symmetrical epicanthic folds were found in all preoperatively. Seventy-one per cent had severe folds. Preoperative intercanthal distance ratio range was 1.26-1.60 (non-BPES=1.0). Median reduction post surgery was 26% (P=0.001, Wilcoxon's signed ranks test). Patients with largest preoperative ratio displayed greatest correction (P=0.029). Mustarde technique completely abolished all epicanthic folds and unmasked prominent caruncles in all. Fifty per cent had mild scarring postoperatively in the medial canthal region. Median change in marginal reflex distance ratio (right)=22.2% (P=0.012), left=18.2% (P=0.008), Wilcoxon's signed ranks tests. Postoperatively all had formed eyelid creases with improved upper lid position symmetry. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first known study objectively assessing surgical outcome in BPES. Mustarde double z plasty and Crawford autogenous fascia lata brow suspension are an effective surgical combination in the treatment of this syndrome, with overall cosmetic benefit.

17451085|a|Patients with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) can be classified as types 1 or 2, according to the presence or not of ovarian failure. We report a 5 year-old girl with BPES and large multicystic ovaries who developed peripheral precocious puberty with thelarche (Tanner stage III) and pubarche (Tanner stage II). Pelvic ultrasound revealed pubertal uterus and enlarged multicystic ovaries. Fibrous dysplasia and McCune-Albright syndrome were ruled out. Treatment with an estrogen antagonist was started (tamoxifen, 10 mg/day), achieving regression of thelarche. Tamoxifen treatment was stopped at 10-(7/12) years, and growth velocity and skeletal maturation rate returned to normal. No treatment-associated adverse effects were observed.

17591462|t|The developmental expression of foxl2 in the dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula.
17591462|a|The FoxL2 genes are a subfamily of the Fox (forkhead box) gene family. FOXL2 is mutated in the disorder Blepharophimosis, Ptosis, and Epicanthus Inversus Syndrome (BPES), which is characterized by eyelid malformations, and Premature Ovarian Failure (POF). In the mouse expression is seen in the perioptic mesenchyme, developing eyelids, ovary and pituitary. We have isolated a foxl2 cDNA from the dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula (also known as the lesser spotted catshark), allowing the characterisation of this gene's sequence and expression from a lineage that diverged early in the evolution of gnathostomes. Molecular phylogenetic analysis strongly grouped this sequence with the gnathostomes within the FoxL2 subfamily. We demonstrate the early expression of Scyliorhinus canicula foxl2 in the mandibular head mesoderm and later in continuous populations of mandibular arch cells and mandibular head mesenchyme cells around the developing pituitary. As development proceeds expression decreases in the mesenchyme of the head but is seen in the mesenchyme around the eye and later in the developing eyelids. Additionally expression is seen in regions of pharyngeal arch mesoderm and in ectoderm from which gill buds will form. This expression is maintained in the developing and elongating gill buds. Thus, S. canicula foxl2 is a marker for the mandibular mesoderm and gill buds and its expression is conserved in the perioptic mesenchyme, developing eyelids and pituitary.

17897532|t|[Mutation analysis of FOXL2 gene and its structure protein in patients of blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome].
17897532|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of mutations of the forkhead transcription factor 2 (FOXL2) gene on the primary and secondary structure of the coded protein and seek for the molecular mechanism of blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES). METHODS: The genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood of 7 clinically diagnosed BPES patients, PCR amplification of FOXL2 coding region and 5' untranslated region were performed. Sequence analysis was performed using the PCR or cloning products. The structure of the protein was predicted with PDH and ExPASy software, and the difference between the normal and the mutational protein was analyzed. RESULTS: A 901- 930 dup 30 mutation of FOXL2 was found in two patients from a BPES family of type II and a sporadic case, and no any mutations were detected in normal control. Analysis of the primary structure displayed that the molecular weight of the protein coded by the mutated gene was greater than the normal, but both have the same isoelectric point. Analysis of the secondary structure showed that FOXL2 was a transmembrane protein with a polyalanine tract which contained a alpha-helix. When the polyalanine tract expanded, the helix region extended, as a result, the proportion of alpha-helix increased by 4.1%, but the proportions of beta-pleated sheet and random coil decreased correspondingly. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the 901 - 930 dup 30 mutation of FOXL2 is a novel finding. Moreover, this mutation causes great changes in the primary and secondary structure of the coded protein, which may be the molecular pathogenesis of BPES.

18155828|t|The mutations and potential targets of the forkhead transcription factor FOXL2.
18155828|a|Mutations of FOXL2, a gene encoding a forkhead transcription factor, have been shown to cause the blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES). This genetic disorder is characterized by eyelid and mild craniofacial abnormalities that can appear associated with premature ovarian failure. FOXL2 is one of the earliest ovarian markers and it offers, along with its targets, an excellent model to study ovarian development and function in normal and pathological conditions. In this review we summarize recent data concerning FOXL2, its mutations and its potential targets. Indeed, many mutations have been described in the coding sequence of FOXL2. Among them, polyalanine expansions and premature nonsense mutations have been shown to induce protein aggregation. In the context of the ovary, FOXL2 has been suggested to be involved in the regulation of cholesterol and steroid metabolism, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species detoxification and inflammation processes. The elucidation of the impact of FOXL2 mutations on its function will allow a better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the BPES phenotype.

18363172|t|Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome in a girl with chromosome translocation t(2;3)(q33;q23).
18363172|a|We report on a young female patient with the clinical features of blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES, OMIM 110100) and a balanced chromosome translocation 46, XX, t(2;3)(q33;q23)dn.BPES is a rare autosomal dominant congenital disorder characterized by the eponymous oculo-facial features that are, in female patients, associated either with (type 1 BPES) or without (type 2 BPES) premature ovarian failure. Both types of BPES are caused by heterozygous mutations in the FOXL2 gene, which is located in chromosome band 3q23. Chromosome aberrations such as balanced rearrangements have only rarely been observed in BPES patients but can provide valuable information about regulatory regions of FOXL2. The translocation in this patient broadens our knowledge of pathogenic mechanisms in BPES and highlights the importance of conventional cytogenetic investigations in patients with negative results of FOXL2 mutation screening as a prerequisite for optimal management and genetic counseling.

18372316|a|Mutations of the FOXL2 gene have been shown to cause blepharophimosis syndrome (BPES), characterized by an eyelid malformation associated with premature ovarian failure or not. Recently, polyalanine expansions and truncating FOXL2 mutations have been shown to lead to protein mislocalization, aggregation and altered transactivation. Here, we study the molecular consequences of 17 naturally occurring FOXL2 missense mutations. Most of them map to the conserved DNA-binding forkhead domain (FHD). The subcellular localization and aggregation pattern of the mutant FOXL2 proteins in COS-7 cells was variable and ranged from a diffuse nuclear distribution like the wild-type to extensive nuclear aggregation often in combination with cytoplasmic mislocalization and aggregation. We also studied the transactivation capacity of the mutants in FOXL2 expressing granulosa-like cells (KGN). Several mutants led to a loss-of-function, while others are suspected to induce a dominant negative effect. Interestingly, one mutant that is located outside the FHD (S217F), appeared to be hypermorphic and had no effect on intracellular protein distribution. This mutation gives rise to a mild BPES phenotype. In general, missense mutations located in the FHD lead to classical BPES and cannot be correlated with expression of the ovarian phenotype. However, a potential predictive value of localization and transactivation assays in the making of genotype-phenotype correlations is proposed. This is the first study to demonstrate that a significant number of missense mutations in the FHD of FOXL2 lead to mislocalization, protein aggregation and altered transactivation, and to provide insights into the pathogenesis associated with missense mutations of FOXL2 in human disease.

18484667|t|Differential functional effects of novel mutations of the transcription factor FOXL2 in BPES patients.
18484667|a|Mutations of the transcription factor FOXL2, involved in cranio-facial and ovarian development lead to the Blepharophimosis-Ptosis-Epicanthus Inversus Syndrome (BPES) in human. Here, we describe nine mutations in the open reading frame of FOXL2. Six of them are novel: c.292T>A (p.Trp98Arg), c.323T>C (p.Leu108Pro), c.650C>G (p.Ser217Cys) and three frameshifts. We have performed localization and functional studies for three of them. We have observed a strong cytoplasmic mislocalization induced by the missense mutation p.Leu108Pro located in the forkhead (FKH) domain of FOXL2. In line with this, transcriptional activity assays confirmed the loss-of-function induced by this variant. Interestingly, the novel mutation p.Ser217Cys, mapping between the FKH and the polyalanine domain of FOXL2 and producing a mild eyelid phenotype, led to normal localization and transactivation. We have also modeled the structure of the FKH domain to explore the potential structural impact of the mutations reported here and other previously reported ones. This analysis shows that mutants can be sorted into two classes: those that potentially alter protein-protein interactions and those that might disrupt the interactions with DNA. Our findings reveal new insights into the molecular effects of FOXL2 mutations, especially those affecting the FKH binding domain. (c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

18492087|t|Dysmorphic syndrome of hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy associated with a SEPT9 gene mutation--a family study.
18492087|a|We report a family in which two siblings presented with an apparent dysmorphic syndrome, including hypotelorism, blepharophimosis, slight ptosis, epicanthal folds, microstomia and dysmorphic ears. One sibling had a cleft palate. Initially, blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) was suspected; however, mutation of the FOXL2 gene was not detected. Moreover, the patients' father and paternal grandmother had experienced recurrent episodes of unilateral brachial neuritis and were diagnosed to have hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy (HNA). HNA is a rare, inherited form of brachial neuritis whose phenotypic spectrum may include hypotelorism, cleft palate and other minor dysmorphisms. HNA maps to chromosome 17q25 and is associated with mutations in the SEPT9 gene. After confirming a heterozygous SEPT9 mutation (R88W) in the father and his mother, it became apparent that the dysmorphic features in the children were part of HNA and that previous complaints of the daughter, erroneously diagnosed as pronatio dolorosa and then epiphysiolysis of the capitellum humeri, were in fact a first neuralgic pain attack. Both children were shown to have inherited the paternal SEPT9 mutation. Wider recognition of HNA as a syndromic disorder may facilitate its diagnosis in affected young persons who may not yet have manifested episodes of brachial neuritis.

18642388|t|Identification of 34 novel and 56 known FOXL2 mutations in patients with Blepharophimosis syndrome.
18642388|a|Blepharophimosis syndrome (BPES) is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the single-exon forkhead transcription factor gene FOXL2 and by genomic rearrangements of the FOXL2 locus. Here, we focus on 92 new intragenic FOXL2 mutations, 34 of which are novel. Specifically, we found 10 nonsense mutations (11%), 13 missense mutations (14%), 40 deletions or insertions leading to a frameshift (43%), and 29 in-frame changes (32%), of which 28 (30%) lead to a polyalanine expansion. This study confirms the existence of two previously described mutational hotspots. Moreover, we gained novel insights in genotype-phenotype correlations, emphasizing the need to interpret genotype-phenotype correlations individually and always in the context of further clinical observations.

18726931|t|FOXL2 mutations and genomic rearrangements in BPES.
18726931|a|The FOXL2 gene is one of 10 forkhead genes, the mutations of which lead to human developmental disorders, often with ocular manifestations. Mutations in FOXL2 are known to cause blepharophimosis syndrome (BPES), an autosomal dominant eyelid malformation associated (type I) or not (type II) with ovarian dysfunction, leading to premature ovarian failure (POF). In addition, a few mutations have been described in patients with isolated POF. Here, we review all currently described FOXL2 sequence variations and genomic rearrangements in BPES and POF. Using a combined mutation detection approach, it is possible to identify the underlying genetic defect in a major proportion (88%) of typical BPES patients. Of all genetic defects found in our BPES cohort, intragenic mutations represent 81%. They include missense changes, frameshift and nonsense mutations, in-frame deletions, and duplications, that are distributed along the single-exon gene. Genomic rearrangements comprising both deletions encompassing FOXL2 and deletions located outside its transcription unit, represent 12% and 5% of all genetic defects in our BPES cohort, respectively. One of the challenges of genetic testing in BPES is the establishment of genotype-phenotype correlations, mainly with respect to the ovarian phenotype. Genetic testing should be performed in the context of genetic counseling, however, and should be systematically complemented by a multidisciplinary clinical follow-up. Another challenge for health care professionals involved in BPES is the treatment of the eyelid phenotype and the prevention or treatment of POF.

18953567|t|Identification of copy number variants associated with BPES-like phenotypes.
18953567|a|Blepharophimosis-Ptosis-Epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a well-characterized rare syndrome that includes an eyelid malformation associated with (type I) or without premature ovarian failure (type II). Patients with typical BPES have four major characteristics: blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus and telecanthus. Mutations in the FOXL2 gene, encoding a forkhead transcription factor, are responsible for the majority of both types of BPES. However, many patients with BPES-like features, i.e., having at least two major characteristics of BPES, have an unidentified cause. Here, we report on a group of 27 patients with BPES-like features, but without an identified genetic defect in the FOXL2 gene or flanking region. These patients were analyzed with whole-genome high-density arrays in order to identify copy number variants (CNVs) that might explain the BPES-like phenotype. In nine out of 27 patients (33%) CNVs not previously described as polymorphisms were detected. Four of these patients displayed psychomotor retardation as an additional clinical characteristic. In conclusion, we demonstrate that BPES-like phenotypes are frequently caused by CNVs, and we emphasize the importance of whole-genome copy number screening to identify the underlying genetic causes of these phenotypes.

19172509|t|Congenital alacrima in a patient with blepharophimosis syndrome.
19172509|a|PURPOSE: To report a case of congenital alacrima in a patient with Blepharophimosis Syndrome (BPES). METHODS: Case report of a 9-month-old female who presented with severe dry eyes. Further investigation revealed bilateral absence of lacrimal glands confirmed by CT. This unique case and its management are discussed. RESULTS: Conservative management with artificial tears and ointment did not treat the ocular surface dryness. A combination of aggressive lubrication with surgical occlusion of the lower lid punctums was required to improve the corneal surface. CONCLUSION: BPES can be associated with many ophthalmic and facial abnormalities. Review of the pubmed literature, reveals this is the first reported case of alacrima and BPES. Patient with alacrima have severe ocular surface dryness, which requires aggressive and life long lubrication and tear supplementation.

19205791|t|Multistage correction of blepharophimosis: our rationale for 18 cases.
19205791|a|BACKGROUND: Due to the complexity of staging order and the number of surgical procedures required to correct blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus (BPES), this study aimed to analyze multistage correction of BPES syndrome objectively. METHODS: This retrospective study was undertaken with 18 BPES patients who underwent multistage correction from April 2004 to September 2007. Data regarding levator function, horizontal palpebral fissure length (HPFL), vertical interpalpebral fissure height (IPFH), inner intercanthal distance (IICD), and the ratio of IICD to HPFL were recorded and analyzed. Facial photographs were taken both pre- and postoperatively. Any complications were documented. RESULTS: The Mustarde method was used for 13 patients, and the Y-to-V technique was selected for 5 patients. In addition, seven patients also received lateral canthoplasty. All the patients underwent frontalis aponeurosis suspension. Changes in both IICD and HPFL were statistically significant (P < 0.001). The IPFH also showed statistically significant improvement after surgery. The range in the preoperative ratio of IICD to HPFL was 1.48-2.35 (mean, 2.04 +/- 0.28). Postoperatively, the ratios for all the patients were less than 1.8 (range, 1.1-1.5; mean, 1.28 +/- 0.13). Changes in the ratio of IICD to HPFL were statistically significant (P < 0.001). Mild undercorrection was observed in two patients postoperatively. Although neither keratitis nor overcorrection occurred, conjunctiva prolapse was experienced by one patient 10 days after frontalis aponeurosis suspension. CONCLUSION: Staged surgery for correction of BPES syndrome is beneficial in terms of improved function and cosmesis.

19371227|t|Mutations of the transcription factor FOXL2 gene in Chinese patients with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome.
19371227|a|Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is an autosomal dominant syndrome of eyelid malformations with (type I) or without (type II) associated premature ovarian failure. Multiple mutations in the exon and the putative core promoter region of FOXL2 gene encoding a putative forkhead transcription factor have been linked to this disease. To examine whether FOXL2 gene mutations contribute to BPES in the Chinese patient population, we screened 33 patients from 18 Chinese families with BPES of unknown types, together with 57 healthy individuals, including 27 relatives of the affected families. Genomic DNA was extracted from the participants' peripheral blood leukocytes, and amplified by polymerase chain reaction for various regions of the FOXL2 gene, followed by sequencing analysis. Ten mutations in the FOXL2 gene were detected: four were previously reported (g.1041_1042insC, g.1366_1367insT, g.909_938dup30, and g.900_929dup30), and six were novel ones (g.406T>A, g.-14G>A, g.1108_1109insC, g.2577C>T, g.1987C>A, and g.1002C>G). Among them, mutations in the coding region for the polyalanine tract, as well as novel mutations in the core promoter, the 3'-UTR, and in the forkhead domain were identified. Our results expanded the spectrum of FOXL2 mutations in BPES and provided additional valuable genetic information for this rare disease.

19429596|t|Functional evidence implicating FOXL2 in non-syndromic premature ovarian failure and in the regulation of the transcription factor OSR2.
19429596|a|BACKGROUND: FOXL2 encodes a forkhead transcription factor whose mutations are responsible for the blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES), involving craniofacial/palpebral abnormalities often associated with premature ovarian failure (POF). RESULTS: We describe a FOXL2 variant (p.Gly187Asp) in a case of POF without BPES. The subcellular localisation of FOXL2-G187D was normal but its transactivation capacity tested on two reporter promoters, one of which should be relevant to the ovary, was significantly lower than that of normal FOXL2. However, FOXL2-G187D was able to activate strongly a reporter construct driven by the promoter of Osr2 (odd-skipped related 2 transcription factor), which we have suggested to be a crucial target of FOXL2 in the craniofacial region. This is compatible with the absence of BPES in our patient. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide evidence in favour of the implication of FOXL2 variants in non-syndromic POF and confirm the regulatory interaction between FOXL2 and OSR2 whose perturbation might contribute to the palpebral abnormalities observed in BPES patients.

19515849|t|Towards a functional classification of pathogenic FOXL2 mutations using transactivation reporter systems.
19515849|a|Mutations of FOXL2 are responsible for the Blepharophimosis-Ptotsis-Epicantus-inversus Syndrome (BPES), involving complex eyelid malformations often associated with premature ovarian failure (POF). Loss-of-function mutations are expected to lead to BPES associated with POF, whereas hypomorphic mutations would lead to BPES without ovarian dysfunction. However, multiple exceptions to the genotype-phenotype correlation have been described and missense mutations in the forkhead domain can lead to either type of BPES. This renders almost impossible the prediction of a POF condition from a given genotype. Moreover, no clear-cut correlation between nuclear and/or cytoplasmic aggregation or cytoplasmic retention of mutant FOXL2 forms and the BPES type has been established thus far. Here, we dissect the molecular and functional effects of 10 FOXL2 mutants, known to induce BPES associated with POF or not. We found a correlation between the transcriptional activity of FOXL2 variants on two different reporter promoters and the type of BPES. We used this functional classification framework to explore the behavior of 18 missense mutations leading to BPES of unknown type. The reporters used enabled us to assess the risk of POF associated with these mutations. Moreover, we document a previously overlooked correlation between subcellular mislocalization and aggregation of mutant FOXL2 and the type of BPES, known or predicted using our reporter assays. Thus, intranuclear aggregation and cytoplasmic mislocalization of mutant FOXL2 may be considered as loose predictors of ovarian dysfunction. The functional classification tool described here is a first step towards circumventing the lack of a clear-cut genotype-phenotype correlation in BPES.

19543368|t|Disease-causing 7.4 kb cis-regulatory deletion disrupting conserved non-coding sequences and their interaction with the FOXL2 promotor: implications for mutation screening.
19543368|a|To date, the contribution of disrupted potentially cis-regulatory conserved non-coding sequences (CNCs) to human disease is most likely underestimated, as no systematic screens for putative deleterious variations in CNCs have been conducted. As a model for monogenic disease we studied the involvement of genetic changes of CNCs in the cis-regulatory domain of FOXL2 in blepharophimosis syndrome (BPES). Fifty-seven molecularly unsolved BPES patients underwent high-resolution copy number screening and targeted sequencing of CNCs. Apart from three larger distant deletions, a de novo deletion as small as 7.4 kb was found at 283 kb 5' to FOXL2. The deletion appeared to be triggered by an H-DNA-induced double-stranded break (DSB). In addition, it disrupts a novel long non-coding RNA (ncRNA) PISRT1 and 8 CNCs. The regulatory potential of the deleted CNCs was substantiated by in vitro luciferase assays. Interestingly, Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) of a 625 kb region surrounding FOXL2 in expressing cellular systems revealed physical interactions of three upstream fragments and the FOXL2 core promoter. Importantly, one of these contains the 7.4 kb deleted fragment. Overall, this study revealed the smallest distant deletion causing monogenic disease and impacts upon the concept of mutation screening in human disease and developmental disorders in particular.

19592504|t|FOXL2 gene mutations and blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES): a novel mutation detected in a Chinese family and a statistic model for summarizing previous reported records.
19592504|a|Previous studies found that the forkhead transcription factor 2 (FOXL2) gene mutations are responsible for both types of blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) but have not established any systematic statistic model for the complex and even contradictory results about genotype-phenotype correlations between them. This study is aimed to find possible mutations of FOXL2 gene in a Chinese family with type II BPES by using DNA sequencing and to further clarify genotype-phenotype correlations between FOXL2 mutations and BPES by using a systematic statistical method, namely Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR). A novel mutation (g.933_965dup) which could result in an expansion of the polyalanine (polyAla) tract was detected in all patients of this family. MDR analysis for intragenic mutations of FOXL2 gene reported in previous BPES studies indicated that the mutations which led to much stronger disturbance of amino acid sequence were responsible for more type I BPES, while other kinds of mutation were responsible for more type II BPES. In conclusion, the present study found a novel FOXL2 gene mutation in a Chinese BPES family and a new general genotype-phenotype correlation tendency between FOXL2 intragenic mutations and BPES, both of which expanded the knowledge about FOXL2 gene and BPES.

19819892|a|FOXL2 mutations cause the autosomal dominant Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) that may be associated with premature ovarian failure (POF). However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of FOXL2 actions in the human ovary. We conducted an extensive clinical, hormonal and ovarian histological study in two patients carrying a FOXL2 mutation associated with the typical eyelid malformations and infertility. This observational study was conducted at referral centres for POF. Histological and immunohistological studies were conducted on ovarian biopsies from two women with POF carrying a FOXL2 mutation resulting in putative polyalanine expansions of the protein. Abnormalities similar to those observed in mice with FOXL2 gene inactivation were present in the first patient's ovary, although the ovarian histology of the second patient was apparently normal. Different ovarian phenotypes, follicular defects and distribution of FOXL2 protein were observed in two patients carrying a FOXL2 mutation.

19917504|a|FOXL2 is expressed in granulosa cells (GC) of small and medium ovarian follicles, functions as a repressor of the human steroidogenic acute regulatory gene, a marker of a GC differentiation, and its mutation is associated with premature ovarian failure (POF) in women with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES), type I. We now report that FOXL2 also represses the transcription of aromatase, P450scc, and cyclin D2, three other key genes involved in GC proliferation, differentiation, and steroidogenesis, and that a FOXL2 mutation found in patients with BPES type I, also fails to repress aromatase transcription, further supporting a role for FOXL2 in follicle maturation.

19929410|t|Identification of a novel mutation in FOXL2 gene that leads to blepharophimosis ptosis epicanthus inversus and telecanthus syndrome in a Tunisian consanguineous family.
19929410|a|Mutations in FOXL2 gene are responsible for blepharophimosis ptosis epicanthus inversus and telecanthus syndrome (BPES). The BPES syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disease characterized by eyelid malformations associated with premature ovarian failure (BPES type I) or not (BPES type II). The human FOXL2 protein (376 aa) contains a 100 amino-acid DNA-binding forkhead domain (residues 52-152) and a polyalanine tract (residues 221-234). In the present study, we report the molecular investigation of four affected members with BPES syndrome in a Tunisian consanguineous family. To identify the causative mutation, we performed a direct sequencing of the FOXL2 gene. The sequence analysis of the coding exon revealed a novel frameshift mutation g.1113 dup C, c.876 dup C, p.P292 Fs. The mutation is located downstream of the polyalanine tract and causes the protein extension to 532 aa. This study reports for the first time a novel frameshift mutation in two-generation consanguineous Tunisian family with BPES. Our results expand the spectrum of FOXL2 mutations.

In this research, we studied the histological structure and ultrastructure of medial canthal ligament of patients with BPES. METHODS: Thirty patients with BPES who received plastic surgery at the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center from March 2006 to January 2008 were studied. There were 17 males and 13 females with an average age of (8.73 +/- 3.37) years (3 - 31 years). The medial canthal ligaments of patients were collected during the plastic surgery to analyze the histological structure by hematoxylin and eosin (HE), Congo red, van Gieson's (VG), Masson trichrome and aldehyde-fuchsin staining. The ultrastructures of the medial canthal ligaments were also analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fifteen samples of medial canthal ligament from healthy persons with an average age of (9.02 +/- 3.12) years (6 - 30 years) were collected as a control group. RESULTS: Morphological and histological study showed that the medial canthal ligaments of BPES patients were composed of collagen fibers, a few elastic fibers and striated muscles. The collagen fibers assemblies were disorganized and the fibrous connective tissues were undergoing hyaline degeneration. The karyopycnosis of fibroblasts was located among the collagen fibrils and the numbers of fibroblasts were decreased. Ultrastructural study with SEM showed that the collagen fibers were larger than normal, irregular and loose. Parts of the collagen fibers were broken and had a coarse surface. Ultrastructural study with TEM showed that the fibroblasts had less cytoplasm, fewer organelles and the nucleus displayed pyknosis. CONCLUSIONS: The medial canthal ligament in BPES patients is composed chiefly of collagen fibers. The collagen fibers of medial canthal ligaments in BPES patients are disorganized and hyaline degeneration is present. The study revealed that the medial canthal ligament of BPES patients might have congenital dysplasia.

19957843|t|[Clinical results of primary and complex resection of levator palpebrae superioris musculus in treatment of blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome].
19957843|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical outcome of treating blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) by means of primary and complex resection of levator palpebrae superioris musculus. METHODS: From May 2001 to May 2007, 12 patients with BPES were treated, including 6 males and 6 females aged 4-15 years old (average 7 years old). All patients marked signs of BPES--typical ptosis of the upper eyelids, epicanthus inversus, palpebral fissure, and increased distance between inner canthus. The eye fissure width was (2.8 +/- 1.8) mm, the eye fissure length was (19.8 +/- 4.7) mm, and the inner canthi diameter was (41.6 +/- 6.5) mm. The muscular strength of levator palpebrae superioris was deficient in 4 cases, the muscular strength of levator palpebrae superioris was (2.0 +/- 0.6) mm in 8 cases. All patients were associated with visual function congenital defects of varying degrees. The surgical technique included shortening of the internal canthal ligaments, resection of the tarsus and levator muscle, and skin plasty. RESULTS: All the incisions healed by first intension. Twelve patients were followed up for 12-48 months (average 30 months). Amelioration of ptosis and epicanthus was achieved. At 18 months after operation, the eye fissure width of 10 patients was (9.0 +/- 2.1) mm, the eye fissure length was (26.5 +/- 3.5) mm, and inner canthi diameter was (30.2 +/- 2.7) mm, the muscular strength of levator palpebrae superioris increased to (5.6 +/- 1.9) mm, showing significant difference when compared with preoperation (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The primary and complex resection of levator palpebrae superioris musculus can provide relating good cosmetic and functional results for the correction of BPES. Patients with BPES should receive surgery as early as possible.

19969293|t|A new FOXL2 gene mutation in a woman with premature ovarian failure and sporadic blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome.
19969293|a|OBJECTIVE: To describe a new FOXL2 gene mutation in a woman with sporadic blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: University medical center. PATIENT(S): A 28-year-old woman. INTERVENTION(S): Clinical evaluation, hormone assays, gene mutation research. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): FOXL2 gene mutation. RESULT(S): The patient with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism was diagnosed with BPES due to a new FOXL2 gene mutation. CONCLUSION(S): Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome is a rare disorder associated with premature ovarian failure (POF). The syndrome is an autosomal dominant trait that causes eyelid malformations and POF in affected women. Mutations in FOXL2 gene, located in chromosome 3, are related to the development of BPES with POF (BPES type I) or without POF (BPES type II). This report demonstrates a previously undescribed de novo mutation in the FOXL2 gene-a thymidine deletion, c.627delT (g.864delT)-in a woman with a sporadic case of BPES and POF. This mutation leads to truncated protein production that is related to a BPES type I phenotype. This report shows the importance of family history and genetic analysis in the evaluation of patients with POF and corroborates the relationship between mutations on the FOXL2 gene and ovarian insufficiency.

20067892|t|The transcription factor FOXL2 in ovarian function and dysfunction.
20067892|a|The Blepharophimosis Ptosis Epicanthus-inversus Syndrome is a genetic disease characterized by complex eyelid malformations often associated with premature ovarian failure (POF). BPES is basically an autosomal dominant disease, due to mutations in the FOXL2 gene, which encodes a forkhead transcription factor. More than one hundred mutations of FOXL2 have been described to date. In agreement with the BPES phenotype, FOXL2 is expressed (though not exclusively) in the developing eyelids and in fetal and adult ovaries. Two mouse knock-out models have been produced. They recapitulate the BPES phenotype and have provided insights into the pathology. Loss-of-function mutations in FOXL2 are predicted to lead to BPES and POF, while hypomorphic mutations might lead to BPES without ovarian dysfunction. However, exceptions to the genotype-phenotype correlation have been described. To better understand the pathogenic effect of these mutations it is crucial to study the normal regulation of FOXL2 and its targets. We briefly address these aspects in this review and hope that basic research around FOXL2 will eventually lead to uncover new therapeutic avenues.

20184535|t|FOXL2 mutations in Taiwanese patients with blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus syndrome.
20184535|a|BACKGROUND: Blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is an autosomal dominant developmental disorder that includes an eyelid malformation associated with (type I) or without (type II) premature ovarian failure (POF). Mutations in the forkhead transcription factor 2 (FOXL2) gene, a member of winged/forkhead transcription factor family, are responsible for both types of BPES. The purpose of this study was to identify mutations in FOXL2 in Taiwanese patients with BPES. METHODS: The karyotype and genomic DNA was prepared from the leukocytes of peripheral venous blood samples. The coding and flanking region sequences of FOXL2 were analyzed by directed or cloning sequencing. RESULTS: The karyotypes of these patients did not show significant variation, especially on the 3q23 region. Two mutations in FOXL2 were identified in two familial cases. One was c.855-871dup (17-bp insertion) associated with POF. The other was c.384G>A (TGG>TGA), a novel mutation that resulted in non-sense changes of the encoded protein, i.e., p.W128X. CONCLUSIONS: Our results expand the spectrum of FOXL2 mutations and confirm the mutation hotspot in FOXL2 in Taiwanese BPES patients.

20207836|t|FOXL2 interacts with steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) and represses SF-1-induced CYP17 transcription in granulosa cells.
20207836|a|Mutations in FOXL2 are responsible for blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) type I, in which affected women exhibit premature ovarian failure. FOXL2-null mice showed defects in granulosa cell development during folliculogenesis. We screened a rat ovarian yeast two-hybrid cDNA library to identify FOXL2-interacting proteins and found steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1). Here, we show that human FOXL2 and SF-1 proteins interact in human granulosa cells and that FOXL2 negatively regulates the transcriptional activation of a steroidogenic enzyme, CYP17, by SF-1. Furthermore, FOXL2 mutants found in blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome type I patients lost the ability to repress CYP17 induction mediated by SF-1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and EMSA results further revealed that FOXL2 inhibited the binding of SF-1 to the CYP17 promoter, whereas the FOXL2 mutants failed to block this interaction. Therefore, this study identifies a novel regulatory role for FOXL2 on a key steroidogenic enzyme and provides a possible mechanism by which mutations in FOXL2 disrupt normal ovarian follicle development.

20209145|t|The forkhead transcription factor Foxl2 is sumoylated in both human and mouse: sumoylation affects its stability, localization, and activity.
20209145|a|The FOXL2 forkhead transcription factor is expressed in ovarian granulosa cells, and mutated FOXL2 causes the blepharophimosis, ptosis and epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) and predisposes to premature ovarian failure. Inactivation of Foxl2 in mice demonstrated its indispensability for female gonadal sex determination and ovary development and revealed its antagonism of Sox9, the effector of male testis development. To help to define the regulatory activities of FOXL2, we looked for interacting proteins. Based on yeast two-hybrid screening, we found that FOXL2 interacts with PIAS1 and UBC9, both parts of the sumoylation machinery. We showed that human FOXL2 is sumoylated in transfected cell lines, and that endogenous mouse Foxl2 is comparably sumoylated. This modification changes its cellular localization, stability and transcriptional activity. It is intriguing that similar sumoylation and regulatory consequences have also been reported for SOX9, the male counterpart of FOXL2 in somatic gonadal tissues.

20222838|t|Mutation analysis of FOXL2 gene in Chinese patients with premature ovarian failure.
20222838|a|Premature ovarian failure (POF) has recently been associated with mutations in Forkhead L2 (FOXL2) gene, which also being a candidate for blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus (BPES) syndrome. In the current study, we performed a screening analysis by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing in 118 patients, including one with BPES and her family of six members. The results came back with no novel mutations but one common 30 bp duplication within FOXL2 polyalanine tract in the abovementioned POF plus BPES patient, suggesting mutations in FOXL2 gene was not common among Chinese patients with POF.

20232352|t|FOXL2 copy number changes in the molecular pathogenesis of BPES: unique cohort of 17 deletions.
20232352|a|Blepharophimosis Syndrome (BPES) is an autosomal dominant developmental disorder of the eyelids with or without ovarian dysfunction caused by FOXL2 mutations. Overall, FOXL2deletions represent 12% of all genetic defects in BPES. Here, we have identified and characterized 16 new and one known FOXL2 deletion combining multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), custom-made quantitative PCR (qPCR) and/or microarray-based copy number screening. The deletion breakpoints could be localized for 13 out of 17 deletions. The deletion size is highly variable (29.8 kb - 11.5 Mb), indicating absence of a recombination hotspot. Although the heterogeneity of their size and breakpoints is not reflected in the uniform BPES phenotype, there is considerable phenotypic variability regarding associated clinical findings including psychomotor retardation (8/17), microcephaly (6/17), and subtle skeletal features (2/17). In addition, in all females in whom ovarian function could be assessed, FOXL2 deletions proved to be associated with variable degrees of ovarian dysfunction. In conclusion, we present the largest series of BPES patients with FOXL2 deletions and standardized phenotyping reported so far. Our genotype-phenotype data can be useful for providing a prognosis (i.e. occurrence of associated features) in newborns with BPES carrying a FOXL2 deletion.

20392411|t|Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome in a Pakistani pedigree.
20392411|a|Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a rare developmental ocular disorder. We report this condition affecting 4 members of a Pakistani family across three generations. A 2-year-old girl was brought to the clinic by her father for the correction of her shortened palpebral fissures. Examination findings were consistent with BPES. The girl's father, paternal grandfather and paternal aunt also had identical features. The distance between the medial canthi of the index case was 30 mm, and the lengths of vertical and horizontal palpebral fissure were 6 mm and 20 mm, respectively. BPES must be considered an important differential diagnosis in patients presenting with blepharoptosis and blepharophimosis.

20407010|t|LATS1 phosphorylates forkhead L2 and regulates its transcriptional activity.
20407010|a|Forkhead L2 (FOXL2) is expressed in the ovary and acts as a transcriptional repressor of the steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) gene, a marker of granulosa cell differentiation. Human FOXL2 mutations that produce truncated proteins lacking the COOH terminus result in blepharophimosis/ptosis/epicanthus inversus (BPES) syndrome type I, which is associated with premature ovarian failure (POF). In this study, we investigated whether FOXL2's activity as a transcriptional repressor is regulated by phosphorylation. We found that FOXL2 is phosphorylated at a serine residue and, using yeast two-hybrid screening, identified LATS1 as a potential FOXL2-interacting protein. LATS1 is a serine/threonine kinase whose deletion in mice results in an ovarian phenotype similar to POF. Using coimmunoprecipitation and kinase assays, we confirmed that LATS1 binds to FOXL2 and demonstrated that LATS1 phosphorylates FOXL2 at a serine residue. Moreover, we found that FOXL2 and LATS1 are coexpressed in developing mouse gonads and in granulosa cells of small and medium follicles in the mouse ovary. Last, we demonstrated that coexpression with LATS1 enhances FOXL2's activity as a repressor of the StAR promoter, and this results from the kinase activity of LATS1. These results provide novel evidence that FOXL2 is phosphorylated by LATS1 and that this phosphorylation enhances the transcriptional repression of the StAR gene, a marker of granulosa cell differentiation. These data support our hypothesis that phosphorylation of FOXL2 may be a control mechanism regulating the rate of granulosa cell differentiation and hence, follicle maturation, and its dysregulation may contribute to accelerated follicular development and POF in BPES type I.

20429427|t|FOXL2: at the crossroads of female sex determination and ovarian function.
20429427|a|The gene FOXL2 encodes a forkhead transcription factor whose mutations are responsible for the blepharophimosis ptosis epicanthus-inversus syndrome. This genetic disorder is characterized by eyelid and mild craniofacial abnormalities often in association with premature ovarian failure. FOXL2 orthologs are found throughout the animal phylum and its sequence is highly conserved in vertebrates. FOXL2 is one of the earliest ovarian markers and it offers, alongwith its targets, a model to study ovarian development and function. In this chapter, we review recent data concemingits mutations, targets, regulation and functions. Studies of the cellular consequences of FOXL2 mutations seem to indicate that aggregation is a common pathogenic mechanism. However, no reliable genotype/phenotype correlation has been established to predict the exact impact of point mutations in the coding region of FOXL2. FOXL2 has been suggested to be involved in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis, steroid metabolism, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species detoxification and inflammation processes. Interestingly, all these processes are not equally affected by FOXL2 mutations. The elucidation of the impact of the FOXL2 function in the ovary will allow a better understanding of normal ovarian development and function as well as the pathogenic mechanisms underlying BPES.

21055199|t|[Deletion and mutation analysis to FOXL2 in blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome].
21055199|a|OBJECTIVE: To perform genetic analysis in 5 patients with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) and refine the genotype-phenotype correlation. METHODS: G-band karyotyping, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), SNP array, PCR and sequencing techniques were performed to one patient with BPES and mental retardation and 4 only with BPES. RESULTS: Patient 1 with mental retardation carried a 9.4 Mb heterozygous deletion in chromosome 3q22.1-q23 including FOXL2 gene; Both patient 2 and 3 carried a c.704delG heterozygous mutation of FOXL2, while they were assigned to the different clinical type from those reported previously. Patient 3 was assigned to type II BPES; No mutation of FOXL2 was detected in patient 4 and 5. CONCLUSIONS: There might be the gene(s) responsible for mental retardation within chromosome 3q22.1-q23. It was indicated that the mutation c.704delG in FOXL2 led to a truncated protein is associated with both type I and II of BPES.

21068205|t|Functional study on a novel missense mutation of the transcription factor FOXL2 causes blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES).
21068205|a|Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a rare autosomal dominant disease caused by FOXL2 gene mutations. However, only one missense mutation has been found in family with BPES type I. Here, we report a novel missense mutation in the forkhead domain of the FOXL2 gene (c.340A > G, NM_023067) resulted in the replacement of lysine by glutamic acid at amino acid position 114 of the FOXL2 protein (p.K114E, NP_075555) that was identified in a Chinese family with BPES type I, members of which displayed clinical symptoms such as shortened palpebral fissures, drooping eyelids, a vertical skin fold arising from the lower eyelid, and premature ovarian failure (POF) in affected females. Based on the patients' clinical features and computational analysis of this missense mutation in a three-dimensional structural model, we hypothesised that the mutation might disturb the intermolecular contacts between FOXL2 and the StAR gene. The disturbance of this interaction might contribute to the POF observed in BPES type I patients. We performed subcellular localisation and functional studies and as expected, observed significant nuclear aggregation and cytoplasmic mislocalization of the mutant type protein and loss-of-function was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays, transcriptional activity assays and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. This functional study on a novel missense mutation has important implications for the molecular analysis of this gene.

21146150|t|FOXL2 mutations in Chinese families with Blepharophimosis syndrome (BPES).
21146150|a|Blepharophimosis syndrome (BPES) is a rare, autosomal dominant disease. Two clinical types of BPES have been distinguished. In BPES type I, an eyelid malformation is associated with infertility in affected females as a result of premature ovarian failure. In BPES type II, eyelid anomalies alone are observed. Mutations of FOXL2, which is a gene encoding a forkhead transcription factor, have recently been shown to cause both types of BPES. Here, we report 1 novel duplication mutation of the FOXL2 gene identified in a large Chinese family affected by type II BPES and 1 less recurrent 17-bp duplication in a large Chinese family affected by BPES of an undetermined type. These new cases give additional support to the previously reported genotype-phenotype correlations and our findings have expanded the spectrum of known mutations of the FOXL2 gene.

They present with remarkably similar manifestations comprising variable ID, a coarse facial appearance, including prominent nose and eyebrows, hypogonadism and skin pigmentation abnormalities, and they share an approximately 8.8 Mb overlapping 3q24q25 deletion. Interestingly, one of the present patients was described previously in a clinical report with emphasis on her clinical similarity to the Wisconsin syndrome, suggesting that Wisconsin syndrome might be caused by a (micro) deletion within the 3q24q25 region.

21204220|t|Dandy-Walker malformation associated with heterozygous ZIC1 and ZIC4 deletion: Report of a new patient.
21204220|a|We report on a female patient with Dandy-Walker malformation possibly caused by heterozygous loss of ZIC1 and ZIC4. The patient presented with mental retardation, epilepsy, and multiple congenital malformations including spina bifida, mild dysmorphic facial features including, thick eyebrows, broad nose, full lips, macroglossia, and hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis with enlargement of the fourth ventricle on brain magnetic resonance imaging, which is consistent with Dandy-Walker malformation. A chromosome analysis showed interstitial deletion of chromosome 3q23-q25.1. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and microarray-based genomic analysis revealed the heterozygous deletion of ZIC1 and ZIC4 loci on 3q24. Her facial features were not consistent with those observed in blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) involving FOXL2 abnormality. Other deleted genes at 3q23-25.1 might contribute to the dysmorphic facial appearance. A milder phenotype as the Dandy-Walker malformation in our patient supports the idea that modifying loci/genes can influence the development of cerebellar malformation.

21289058|t|Transcription factor FOXL2 protects granulosa cells from stress and delays cell cycle: role of its regulation by the SIRT1 deacetylase.
21289058|a|FOXL2 is a transcription factor that is essential for ovarian function and maintenance, the germline mutations of which are responsible for the Blepharophimosis Ptosis Epicanthus-inversus Syndrome (BPES), often associated with premature ovarian failure. Recent evidence has linked FOXL2 downregulation or somatic mutation (p.Cys134Trp) to cancer, although underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Using a functional genomic approach, we find that FOXL2 modulates cell-cycle regulators in a way which tends to induce G1 arrest. Indeed, FOXL2 upregulation promotes cell accumulation in G1 phase and protects cells from oxidative damage, notably by promoting oxidized DNA repair and by increasing the amounts of anti-oxidant agent glutathione. In agreement with clinical observations, we find that FOXL2-mutated versions leading to BPES along with ovarian dysfunction mostly fail to transactivate cell-cycle and DNA repair targets, whereas mutations leading to isolated craniofacial defects (and normal ovarian function) activate them correctly. Interestingly, these assays revealed a mild promoter-specific hypomorphy of the tumor-associated mutation (p.Cys134Trp). Finally, the SIRT1 deacetylase suppresses FOXL2 activity on targets linked to cell-cycle and DNA repair in a dose-dependent manner. Accordingly, we find that SIRT1 inhibition by nicotinamide limits proliferation, notably by increasing endogenous FOXL2 amount/activity. The body of evidence presented here supports the idea that FOXL2 plays a key role in granulosa cell homeostasis, the failure of which is central to ovarian ageing and tumorigenesis. As granulosa cell tumors respond poorly to conventional chemotherapy, our findings on the deacetylase inhibitor nicotinamide provide an interesting option for targeted therapy.

21321671|t|Genetic analysis of the FOXL2 gene using quantitative real-time PCR in Chinese patients with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome.
21321671|a|PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to identify the mutation(s) or deletion(s) of the forkhead box protein L2 (FOXL2) gene in Chinese patients with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES). METHODS: Genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood was collected from two Chinese families and from one sporadic case. PCR direct sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR-based copy number screening for the whole exon of FOXL2 were performed. RESULTS: Direct sequencing revealed an indel mutation c.50C TA in the sporadic case which resulted in a frameshift generating 78 novel amino acids and terminating prematurely at codon 95. Deletions in the FOXL2 gene were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (q-real-time PCR) in two families in which intragenic mutations were excluded by direct sequencing. These changes containing deletions and a de novo mutation were not detected either in the non-carrier relatives or in 100 normal controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified two deletions and a de novo mutation in the FOXL2 gene in Chinese BPES patients. This is the first study to report FOXL2 gene deletions detected by q-real-time PCR in this ethnic group. This technique enriches the diagnostic methods of molecular genetics in BPES patients. The de novo mutation expands the mutation spectrum of FOXL2.

21325395|t|Mutation spectrum of fork-head transcriptional factor gene (FOXL2) in Indian Blepharophimosis Ptosis Epicanthus Inversus Syndrome (BPES) patients.
21325395|a|AIM: The fork-head transcription factor gene (FOXL2) gene has been implicated in Blepharophimosis Ptosis Epicanthus Inversus Syndrome (BPES) type I and type II. The authors aimed to evaluate the involvement of FOXL2 in familial and sporadic cases of BPES in an Indian cohort. METHODS: The present cohort comprised clinically well-characterised BPES cases that included six affected families, two sporadic cases and 60 unaffected normal controls. The 5' untranslated and coding region of FOXL2 was screened by resequencing and confirmed by restriction digestion. Further, genotype-phenotype correlations were done to understand the implications of the observed mutation. RESULTS: Six mutations were observed in eight cases (87.5%). These included a novel deletion (c.860delC), three previously reported duplications (c.663-692dup 30, c.672-701dup30 and c.843-859dup17), a frame shift (c.804dupC) and a homozygous missense mutation (p.E69K). The p.E69k mutation was seen in both heterozygous and homozygous form in a large four-generational family, and disease severity was found to be directly linked to the allelic dosage. Two SNPs (c.501C T, c.536C G) were also noted. An unusual coexistence of polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD) with BPES was also seen in one of the families. DISCUSSION: Mutations in the region downstream of the fork-head domain were predominantly responsible for BPES among Indian patients.

21730020|t|Notch gain of function in mouse periocular mesenchyme downregulates FoxL2 and impairs eyelid levator muscle formation, leading to congenital blepharophimosis.
21730020|a|Notch signaling is pivotal for the morphogenesis and homeostasis of many tissues. We found that aberrant Notch activation in mouse neural-crest-derived periocular mesenchymal cells (POMCs), which contribute to the formation of corneal and eyelid stroma, results in blepharophimosis. Compound transgenic mice overexpressing the Notch1 intracellular domain (N1-ICD) in POMCs (POMC(N1-ICD)) showed relatively minor effects on the cornea, but increased cell apoptosis and decreased cell proliferation during eyelid morphogenesis. Eyelid closure at E15.5 and eyelid formation at birth were incomplete. In further analyses, overexpression of N1-ICD impaired eyelid levator smooth muscle formation by downregulating the transcription factor FoxL2. This is similar to the effect of haploinsufficiency of FOXL2 in humans, which results in type II BPES (blepharophimosis, ptosis and epicanthus inversus syndrome). In vitro studies showed that FoxL2 expression is augmented by a low dose of N1-ICD but was downregulated by a high dose, depending on the extent of Hes-1 and Hey-1 activation. Moreover, transfection of CMV-FoxL2 enhanced alpha-SMA promoter activity. These data strongly imply that a physiologically low level of Notch1 is crucial for proper FoxL2 expression in POMCs, which is, in turn, essential for Mueller muscle formation and normal eyelid development.

21825186|t|Increased levator muscle function by supramaximal resection in patients with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome.
21825186|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy and clinical and anatomical results of supramaximal levator resection in patients with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) with severe congenital ptosis with poor levator function (LF). METHODS: Eleven patients with molecularly proven BPES underwent supramaximal levator resection. Palpebral fissure height and LF were measured preoperatively and postoperatively. RESULTS: All patients showed an excellent reduction in ptosis with a single intervention resulting in a clear visual axis. Palpebral fissure height improved from mean (SD) 3.3 (0.7) mm preoperatively to 7.1 (0.9) mm postoperatively (P value <.001). Four patients underwent additional surgery because of cosmetic issues with eyelid height asymmetry. All patients showed a marked, consistent, and lasting improvement in LF, going from mean (SD) 1.9 (0.9) mm preoperatively to 7.4 (1.1) mm postoperatively (P value <.001). This improvement could be attributed to the presence of a very long and thin tendon, as well as a striated muscle belly. This elongated aponeurosis inhibits the levator muscle from having sufficient impact on the vertical eyelid excursion. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that supramaximal levator resection performed in patients with BPES not only results in good cosmetic appearance in terms of ptosis reduction in the majority of cases but also in a significant increase of the levator palpebrae superioris function. An anatomical substrate was found to explain these findings. To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide evidence of a marked increase in LF in BPES due to resection of the elongated tendon with reinsertion of the muscle belly.

22022399|t|SUMOylation of the Forkhead transcription factor FOXL2 promotes its stabilization/activation through transient recruitment to PML bodies.
22022399|a|BACKGROUND: FOXL2 is a transcription factor essential for ovarian development and maintenance. It is mutated in the genetic condition called Blepharophimosis Ptosis Epicantus inversus Syndrome (BPES) and in cases of isolated premature ovarian failure. We and others have previously shown that FOXL2 undergoes several post-translational modifications. METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, using cells in culture, we show that interference with FOXL2 SUMOylation leads to a robust inhibition of its transactivation ability, which correlates with a decreased stability. Interestingly, FOXL2 SUMOylation promotes its transient recruitment to subnuclear structures that we demonstrate to be PML (Promyelocytic Leukemia) Nuclear Bodies. Since PML bodies are known to be sites where post-translational modifications of nuclear factors take place, we used tandem mass spectrometry to identify new post-translational modifications of FOXL2. Specifically, we detected four phosphorylated, one sulfated and three acetylated sites. CONCLUSIONS: By analogy with other transcription factors, we propose that PML Nuclear Bodies might transiently recruit FOXL2 to the vicinity of locally concentrated enzymes that could be involved in the post-translational maturation of FOXL2. FOXL2 acetylation, sulfation, phosphorylation as well as other modifications yet to be discovered might alter the transactivation capacity of FOXL2 and/or its stability, thus modulating its global intracellular activity.

The two entities are further differentiated by incomplete penetrance only in type II and by differences in the sex ratios of the affected children. Female infertility in type I is a predominant symptom, and the distinction between the two types is of importance for genetic counseling.

7633459|t|Definition of the blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus syndrome critical region at chromosome 3q23 based on the analysis of chromosomal anomalies.
7633459|a|Blepharophimosis syndrome (BPES) is an autosomal dominant disorder of craniofacial development, the features of which are small palpebral fissures (blepharophimosis), drooping eyelids (ptosis) and a skin fold arising from the lower eyelid (epicanthus inversus). The chromosomal localization and identity of the BPES locus is not known with certainty. In the current paper, DNA samples from three individuals with a clinical history of BPES, two with interstitial deletions (cases 1 and 2) and one with a balanced translocation (case 3) all involving chromosome 3q23, were analyzed. Allele loss studies using short tandem repeat markers in cases 1 and 2 suggested that the region between the markers D3S1292 and D3S1306 was deleted in both cases. Subsequently, the derived chromosomes resulting from the translocation in case 3 were segregated in interspecific somatic cell hybrids. Analysis of the resultant hybrids showed that D3S1615 was retained in the derived chromosome 3, whereas D3S1316 was retained in the derived chromosome 4. In neither case was the marker present in the reciprocal hybrid. These results indicate that the BPES critical region lies in the D3S1615-D3S1316 interval.

7795600|t|Blepharophimosis syndrome is linked to chromosome 3q.
7795600|a|Blepharophimosis syndrome (BPES, blepharophimosis eyelid syndrome) is a distinctive congenital eyelid malformation which can occur sporadically or be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Previous reports have described associated cytogenetic abnormalities on chromosome 3q. We have ascertained and sampled two BPES families with apparent autosomal dominant inheritance and have tested for linkage with 17 polymorphic markers on 3q. Multipoint analysis generated a maximum LOD score of 3.23 using the markers RHO, ACPP and D3S1238. No evidence of genetic heterogeneity was observed. These studies provide the first non-cytogenetic evidence that a defective gene responsible for BPES is located on 3q22.

7897621|t|Cytogenetic findings indicate heterogeneity in patients with blepharophimosis, epicanthus inversus, and developmental delay.
7897621|a|Three unrelated, mentally retarded boys with typical blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) were found to have chromosomal aberrations. One of them had a del(3)(p25), another patient had a de novo translocation t(2; 3), which after high resolution banding combined with chromosome painting was interpreted to be unbalanced with a loss of band q23. The third patient had a del(7)(q34). The phenotypes of the two patients with chromosome 3 related syndromes were similar, but the third also had genital malformations resembling the Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome. This patient had a palatal ridge, and a single mesial maxillary tooth suggesting the holoprosencephaly sequence, but CT scans of the brain were normal.

8256811|t|Blepharophimosis sequence (BPES) and microcephaly in a girl with del(3) (q22.2q23): a putative gene responsible for microcephaly close to the BPES gene?
8256811|a|We report on a girl with the blepharophimosis sequence (BPES), microcephaly of postnatal onset, mild developmental retardation, and a deletion: 46,XX,del(3) (q22.2q23) de novo. A gene for BPES is suspected to be located at 3q23. Almost all cases with interstitial deletions containing 3q23 have not only BPES but also microcephaly and developmental retardation, while those without deletions, including those with apparently balanced translocations, only have BPES. Thus, a putative gene responsible for microcephaly may exist close to BPES gene. BPES, microcephaly, developmental retardation, and primary amenorrhea might constitute a contiguous gene syndrome.

Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome type 1 is associated with female infertility. Mental subnormality may occur, especially in the sporadic cases.

8800926|t|Refined genetic and physical mapping of BPES type II.
8800926|a|BPES is a genetic disorder including blepharophimosis, ptosis of the eyelids, epicanthus inversus and telecanthus. Type I is associated with female infertility, whereas type II presents without other symptoms. Both types I and II occur sporadically or are inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. We present a molecular genetic and cytogenetic study in a large four-generation Belgian family with BPES type II. Karyotype analysis on high-resolution banded chromosomes yielded normal results. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with cosmid probes spanning 3q22-q24 revealed normal hybridization patterns. Sixteen polymorphic CA repeats encompassing region 3q13-q25 were analysed. Linkage analysis in this large four-generation family provides conclusive evidence for the presence of a BPES gene in this region. Two-point lod scores greater than 3.0 between the disease and the following markers were seen: D3S1589 (4.67), D3S1292 (3.52), D3S1290 (3.59) and D3S1549 (3.65). By FISH, D3S1290, D3S1292 and D3S1549 were assigned to chromosome 3q23 using YACs positive for these markers.

8968762|t|Linkage of blepharophimosis syndrome in a large Indian pedigree to chromosome 7p.
8968762|a|Blepharophimosis syndrome (BPES) is an autosomal dominant disorder involving abnormal eyelid development. Cytogenetic and linkage analyses have previously implicated the chromosome 3q23 region in multiple cases of this syndrome. However, in a few cases cytogenetic analyses have implicated other chromosomal regions in this condition. Here we report linkage of BPES in a large Indian pedigree to chromosome 7p13-p21; affected only two-point and multipoint analyses using D7S488, D7S2551 and D7S2562 both showed peak lod scores of 3.61 coincident with D7S2562. Recombinations in affected individuals placed the critical region between D7S488 and D7S629. When both affected and unaffected individuals were considered, a maximum two-point lod score of 3.38 at theta = 0.08 was obtained with D7S2551 while a peak multipoint lod score of 3.64 was obtained between D7S488 and D7S2551. Segregation analysis revealed two unaffected individuals carrying the affected haplotype accounted for the difference in peak, relative to the affected only analysis. The chromosome 7p candidate genes inhibin beta A and epidermal growth factor receptor map outside this region whereas the HOX1 gene cluster may map inside this region. Although BPES is sometimes associated with female infertility due to premature ovarian failure, in the current family affected females were fertile. The current finding together with the previous evidence implicating chromosome 3q2 provides strong evidence that BPES involves locus heterogeneity; this point should be considered when counselling affected families.

We report on a 3-year-old girl with the phenotype of BPES, mental retardation, facial dysmorphism and camptodactyly. In addition, she had a congenitally small larynx and severe, chronic feeding difficulties. Chromosome studies revealed an interstitial deletion in the long arm of chromosome 3: del(3)(q23-q25). CONCLUSION: Congenital laryngostenosis and severe feeding problems may be part of the clinical syndrome caused by chromosome 3q23 deletion.

9272742|t|A YAC contig spanning the blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome and propionic acidemia loci.
9272742|a|Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is an autosomal dominant condition consisting of congenital dysplasia of the eyelids with a reduced horizontal diameter of the palpebral fissures, droopy eyelids and epicanthus inversus. Two clinical entities have been described: type I and type II. The former is distinguished by female infertility, whereas the latter presents without other symptoms. Both type I and type II were recently mapped on the long arm of chromosome 3 (3q22-q23), suggesting a common gene may be affected. The centromeric and the telomeric limits of this region are well defined between loci D3S1316 and D3S1615, which reside approximately 5 cM apart. Here, we present the construction of a YAC contig spanning the entire BPES locus using 17 polymorphic markers, 2 STS and 28 ESTs. This region of approximately 5 Mb was covered by 31 YACs, and was supported by detailed FISH analysis. In addition, we have precisely mapped the propionyl-CoA carboxylase beta polypeptide (PCCB), the gene mutated in propionic acidemia, within this contig. Apart from providing a framework for the identification of the BPES gene, this contig will also be useful for the future identification of defects and genes mapped to this region, and for developing template resources for genomic sequencing.

9321768|t|A novel case of unilateral blepharophimosis syndrome and mental retardation associated with de novo trisomy for chromosome 3q.
9321768|a|We have evaluated a 3 2/12 year old girl who presented with unilateral blepharophimosis, ptosis of the eyelid, and mental retardation. Additional dysmorphic features include microcephaly, high, narrow forehead, short stubby fingers, and adduction of the right first toe. Cytogenetic analysis showed an unbalanced karyotype consisting of 46,XX,add(7)(q+) that was de novo in origin. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) using microdissected library probe pools from chromosomes 1,2,3,7, and 3q26-qter showed that the additional material on 7q was derived from the distal end of the long arm of chromosome 3. Our results indicate that the patient had an unbalanced translocation, 46,XX,der(7)t(3;7)(q26-qter;q+) which resulted in trisomy for distal 3q. All currently reported cases of BPES (blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome) with associated cytogenetic abnormalities show interstitial deletions or balanced translocations involving 3q22-q23 or 3p25.3. Our patient shares similar features to BPES, except for the unilateral ptosis and absence of epicanthus inversus. It is possible that our patient has a contiguous gene defect including at least one locus for a type of blepharophimosis, further suggesting that multiple loci exist for eyelid development.

9466998|t|A new human homeobox gene OGI2X is a member of the most conserved homeobox gene family and is expressed during heart development in mouse.
9466998|a|Homeodomain (HD) proteins are transcription regulators controlling a variety of cell fates. The HD region characterizing this protein family is a domain of 60 amino acid residues that recognizes and binds a site in the regulatory region of the target gene. It has been suggested that regions outside the HD may determine the specific functions of the various HD proteins by forming additional contacts with DNA sequences or by interactions with other proteins. We have identified a 14 amino acid motif within the C-terminal region of the protein encoded by the RIEG1 gene that is conserved among several HD proteins. Overlapping expression of the genes encoding these proteins during craniofacial development suggested that they might interact with a common factor. In order to identify additional genes possessing this motif we screened a human craniofacial cDNA library with oligoprobes. A novel gene was identified, exhibiting the most homology to murine Og12x (formerly OG12) and the recently reported human SHOX gene. Human OG12X and murine Og12x are highly homologous and the OG12X and Og12x proteins are 100% identical. In situ hybridization on mouse embryos ranging from 9 to 16 days post-coitum localized murine Og12x mRNA in the heart, otic region, maxillary and mandibular components of the first branchial arch, nasal processes, eyelid, midbrain, medulla oblongata, limbs, dorsal root ganglia and genital tubercle. OG12X was mapped to human chromosome 3q22-26 and murine Og12x to the syntenic region on mouse chromosome 3. Based upon the expression pattern of its mouse cognate, OG12X represents a candidate for the blepharophimosis (BPES) and Cornelia de Lange syndromes previously mapped to this region.

9782438|a|BACKGROUND: Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is an autosomal dominant condition mapped to chromosome 3q23. There are several reports of chromosomal abnormalities involving this region with a resultant phenotype that includes BPES. METHOD: We reassessed two unrelated boys ages 3 and 5 with BPES and associated nonocular abnormalities. Karyotype, which had been previously reported as normal, was repeated using high-resolution banding techniques, to look specifically at 3q23. Clinical findings were tabulated and compared with previously reported cases. RESULTS: Both patients proved to have interstitial deletions of chromosome 3, the first involving bands q22.2q25.1 and the second q22.2q24. The first patient exhibited prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, with global developmental delay, while the second patient had normal growth and development except for speech delay. Both had dysmorphic facies with BPES, flat philtrum, a thin upper lip, and small chin. In addition, the first boy had an inguinal hernia and hypospadius; the second boy had abnormal auricles and metatarsus adductus. The eight cases of interstitial deletions of 3q2 and six rearrangements involving this region have a remarkably similar phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Deletion of 3q23 is a recognizable contiguous gene syndrome. Microdeletions of 3q23 should be ruled out in any sporadic case of BPES especially if there are associated nonocular abnormalities.

9799597|t|Refinement of a translocation breakpoint associated with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome to a 280-kb interval at chromosome 3q23.
9799597|a|Blepharophimosis syndrome (BPES) is an autosomal dominant disorder of craniofacial development, the features of which include blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus. Although it has been suggested that BPES is genetically heterogeneous, a major locus for this condition resides at chromosome 3q23. We have previously mapped a translocation breakpoint associated with BPES to the D3S1316-D3S1615 interval. The markers in this region have subsequently been shown to lie in a different order, with the BPES locus mapping to the 1-cM D3S1576 and D3S1316 interval. In the current investigation, a physical map, consisting of 60 yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones and 1 bacterial artificial chromosome, that spans this region has been constructed. Ten expressed sequence tags and the cellular retinol-binding protein I locus have been mapped to the contig. YAC end isolation has led to the creation of novel STSs that have been used to reduce the size of the BPES critical region to a 280-kb interval, which has been cloned in two nonchimeric YACs.

9817424|t|Chiari Type I malformation and syringomyelia in unrelated patients with blepharophimosis. Report of two cases.
9817424|a|Syringomyelia is a rare, mainly sporadic disease of the spinal cord, which is associated with 80% of cases in which a Chiari Type I malformation is also present. A mendelian transmission of syringomyelia (autosomal dominant or recessive) has been proposed in approximately 2% of reported cases. The association of syringomyelia with hereditary diseases (Noonan's syndrome, phacomatoses) has been mentioned frequently in the literature. The authors report the presence of a Chiari Type I malformation accompanied by syringomyelia in two unrelated patients affected by a familial Type II blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES). The first patient was a 35-year-old woman who presented with a right C-8 root paresia. The second case involved a 20-year-old man who complained of cervical radicular pain. Both belong to families in which BPES was segregated in an autosomal dominant modality, but other family members had no known neurological symptoms. To the authors' knowledge, such a combination has never been described. Perhaps the possible involvement of a genetic component in some cases of Chiari Type I-associated syringomyelia will someday be debated.

10191085|t|Closing in on the BPES gene on 3q23: mapping of a de Novo reciprocal translocation t(3;4)(q23;p15.2) breakpoint within a 45-kb cosmid and mapping of three candidate genes, RBP1, RBP2, and beta'-COP, distal to the breakpoint.
10191085|a|BPES is a genetic disorder presenting with blepharophimosis, ptosis of the eyelids, epicanthus inversus, and telecanthus. BPES type I is associated with female infertility, whereas type II presents without additional symptoms. Hitherto, it remains unknown whether BPES type I results from a defect in a single gene or from a contiguous gene syndrome. Previous cytogenetic and linkage analyses have assigned a BPES locus to 3q23, in a 5-cM interval between D3S1615 and D3S1316. In this report, we describe the molecular and physical characterization of the 3q23 breakpoint in a BPES patient with a t(3;4)(q23;p15.2) translocation. Eight YACs located around and within the D3S1615-D3S1316 interval were mapped relative to the 3q23 breakpoint; 5 YACs spanning the 3q23 breakpoint were identified. Thirteen STSs and ESTs were localized on the YAC map. Subsequent hybridization of 2 YACs spanning the breakpoint to the Human RPCI1 PAC Library and the Human Chromosome 3 LLNL Cosmid Library resulted in the identification of 12 PACs and 50 cosmids respectively, allowing the construction of a detailed PAC and cosmid physical map. A refined position-telomeric to the breakpoint-of 3 candidate genes, cellular retinol-binding proteins 1 and 2 (RBP1, RBP2) and the coatomer beta' subunit (beta'-COP), was obtained on this physical map. Furthermore, a PAC and cosmid contig encompassing the breakpoint was constructed. PAC 169-C 10 and cosmid 11-L 10 crossing the breakpoint have sizes of 110 and 45 kb, respectively. The isolation of coding sequences in these clones and in the rest of the contig will greatly facilitate further efforts toward positional cloning of the gene(s) involved in BPES.

10635488|t|[Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus associated with infertility].
10635488|a|Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus syndrome (BPES) is a rare genetic condition occurring sporadically and transmitted by autosomal dominant inheritance. Type I BPES is associated with a high incidence of menstrual irregularities and infertility. Its clinical presentation is attributed to either an ovarian resistance to gonadotropins or to a true premature menopause. Two pathophysiological underlying mechanisms have been proposed: one suggests that one or more mechanisms lead to inhibition of early follicular development or follicule atresia. The other raises the possibility that BPES results from microdeletion of genetic material containing at least 2 independent genes. We report a familial case of BPES identified at birth and who required several surgical procedures. Several members of the patient's family are also affected. Early recognition of this condition may allow appropriate counselling and/or treatments including egg donation in case of hypergonadotropic hypogonadism.

10720572|t|Fine mapping suggests that the goat Polled Intersex Syndrome and the human Blepharophimosis Ptosis Epicanthus Syndrome map to a 100-kb homologous region.
10720572|a|To clone the goat Polled Intersex Syndrome (PIS) gene(s), a chromosome walk was performed from six entry points at 1q43. This enabled 91 BACs to be recovered from a recently constructed goat BAC library. Six BAC contigs of goat chromosome 1q43 (ICC1-ICC6) were thus constructed covering altogether 4.5 Mb. A total of 37 microsatellite sequences were isolated from this 4.5-Mb region (16 in this study), of which 33 were genotyped and mapped. ICC3 (1500 kb) was shown by genetic analysis to encompass the PIS locus in a approximately 400-kb interval without recombinants detected in the resource families (293 informative meioses). A strong linkage disequilibrium was detected among unrelated animals with the two central markers of the region, suggesting a probable location for PIS in approximately 100 kb. High-resolution comparative mapping with human data shows that this DNA segment is the homolog of the human region associated with Blepharophimosis Ptosis Epicanthus inversus Syndrome (BPES) gene located in 3q23. This finding suggests that homologous gene(s) could be responsible for the pathologies observed in humans and goats.

10798354|t|SOX14 is a candidate gene for limb defects associated with BPES and Mobius syndrome.
10798354|a|Members of the SOX gene family encode proteins with homology to the HMG box DNA-binding domain of SRY, the Y-linked testis-determining gene. SOX genes are expressed during embryogenesis and are involved in the development of a wide range of different tissues. Mutations in SRY, SOX9 and SOX10 have been shown to be responsible for XY sex reversal, campomelic dysplasia and Waardenburg-Hirschsprung disease, respectively. It is likely that mutations in other SOX genes are responsible for a variety of human genetic diseases. SOX14 has been identified from a human genomic library and the mouse and chicken sequences obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification. The SOX14 amino acid sequence is highly conserved across these species, suggesting an important role for this protein in vertebrate development. SOX14 is expressed in the neural tube and apical ectodermal ridge of the developing chicken limb. This is the only SOX gene known to be expressed in the apical ectodermal ridge, a structure that directs outgrowth of the embryonic limb bud. Human SOX14 is localised to a 1.15-Mb yeast artificial chromosome on chromosome 3q23, close to loci for BPES (blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus syndrome) and Mobius syndrome. Although SOX14 maps outside these loci, its expression pattern and chromosomal localisation suggest that it is a candidate gene for the limb defects frequently associated with these syndromes.
